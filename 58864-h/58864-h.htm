<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> next morning, at the appointed time, accompanied
by a young Spaniard, as second, Willis was
on the beach, where he found De Vere and his
friend. The foes saluted each other with the most
scrupulous politeness. Ten paces were measured
as the distance, and they took their positions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The signal was given, and both fired, but with
unequal success; at the report De Vere sprung up,
and then fell senseless at full length upon the sand;
Willis was unharmed, and merely asking his opponent’s
second if his friend wished another shot—to
which, of course, he replied in the negative—he got
into his boat, and without even looking at De Vere,
pulled back to the harbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anxious to get away from Havana as soon as
possible, for, since his rencounter with De Vere, he
was confident that Francisca must know his true
character, or rather the character De Vere had
falsely given him, and not desiring to meet her or
her father, Willis made all possible dispatch to get
through with his business; and in two days after
the duel he was again at sea, and bound for Africa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cargo he would bring with him was engaged
to a trader on the other side of the island, and he
did not intend returning to Havana.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a quick and fortunate run over, and was
four days out, on his return, with the best lot of
negroes he had ever obtained, all grown men,
strong and healthy, when he fell in with a sail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He discovered it to be a large ship, to leeward of
him some six or eight miles; he knew her to be a
man-of-war, by the squareness of her yards, and
who, as soon as she saw the Maraposa, took another
pull at the lee-braces, and put her helm a little more
a-lee; but she might as well have tried to sail in the
teeth of a tornado as out-weather the schooner,
though the accuracy with which she maintained her
distance and position proved her to be a remarkably
fast sailer. Willis had no fear of the ship overtaking
him, and held on his course; day after day,
for nearly a week, the two vessels were in the same
relative position, almost on parallel lines, but between
six and eight miles apart; both under all the
sail they could carry. On the eighth day it fell dead
calm, and both the ship and schooner lay motionless
on the smooth water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scorching beams of an equatorial sun rendered
the heat insufferable, even on deck; but in
the hold of the slaver the heat and the stench were
absolutely awful! and the poor negroes, nearly
frantic, were continually shrieking for water and
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their cries brought them small relief. The attention
of Willis and the crew was too much occupied
by other matters, to pay any more attention to the
blacks than see they were secure; for as soon as
the wind died away, the ship had commenced getting
out her boats. Already had Willis seen three
of them lowered over, and he felt confident the captain
of the sloop-of-war intended attacking him with
the whole strength of his crew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One! two! three! more boats he counted, as they
swung an instant in the air, and then dropped in
the water. Aided by his glass, he saw the men
hurrying down the ship’s side to man them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
But he knew it was a work of time and labor to
row eight miles in the intense heat, and it was not
until he had seen the launch, four cutters, and even
the gig, six boats in all, pull round the sloop’s bows,
crowded with men, and forming a line, stretch out
toward the Maraposa, that he commenced preparations
to repel the attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The force approaching was formidable, nearly an
hundred men, and the crew of the slaver, counting
all hands, even Willis and the cook, was barely half
the number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The schooner, acting only on the defensive, and
being so much higher out of the water than the
boats, made this disparity in numbers less to be
dreaded; and the confidence Willis had in his men,
and they in him, made the slavers feel secure in the
result of the approaching struggle; and it was with
a loud and hearty shout that his crew answered,
when Willis called —</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All hands to quarters!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open the magazine! Trice up the boarding-nettings!
and stand by, to give those English fools
h—l! for meddling with what don’t concern them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These orders were soon obeyed, and the schooner
with her six caronnades looking through the port-holes,
double boarding-nettings triced up, and her
desperate crew armed to the teeth, with calm, determined
resolution printed on their countenances,
quietly watching the coming foe, was the personification
of men “grown old in desperate hardihood;”
fortified with the determination of resisting to the
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The line of black boats, with their long oars regularly
rising and falling, resembled huge beetles, as
they came across the glass-like sea; and in an hour
and a half they were within a mile of the schooner.
Shot after shot was fired at them from the long gun
of the Maraposa, but unharmed they steadily approached
to within the distance of a hundred yards,
when, with a loud huzza, they formed abreast, the
launch a little in advance, and made a dash at the
schooner, with the intention of all boarding at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then was heard the thunder of the three larboard
caronnades, as they hurled forth their iron hail, and
a yell of agony, and the sudden swamping of the
launch and fourth cutter attested the deadly effect
of the fire; but the other boats undaunted, before
the guns could be again loaded, had reached the
vessel, and, with shouts and hoarse huzzas, were
trying to board her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the attempt was futile! with boarding-pike,
cutlas point, and pistol shot, her hardy crew repulsed
them. Again! and again! with the determined
and dogged courage of English tars, they
endeavored to get on deck, but the men of the
slaver, cheered on by Willis, drove them back each
time with loss, and the lieutenant in command of
the expedition, fearing all his men would be lost,
drew off. Another broadside from the schooner
sunk one more of the boats, and pulling as quickly
as possible out of the range of the slavers’ guns,
with slow and feeble strokes, crest fallen, and deprived
of half their boats and men, the attacking
party proceeded toward their ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ere they had accomplished a third of the distance,
the ship was seen to square away her yards, and
commenced moving through the water to meet
them; the wind had sprung up again, but coming
out from the south’ard, it brought the ship to windward,
instead of to leeward, as she had been before
the calm, and feeling its effects first, she was gathering
way before the schooner felt it; soon however
it reached the slaver, and with her sheets eased off,
the Maraposa commenced merrily to continue her
course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willis had only four men killed in the late action,
and with his feelings elated at the severe repulse
he had given the men-of-wars-men, whom he cordially
hated for their incessant persecution of the
slavers, and whose boasted philanthropy, the motive
which they pretend actuates them, he was
aware was only practiced for the effect it had upon
the world, and not for any benefit the Africans derived;
for he knew that the condition of the recaptured
negroes, as English apprentices, was infinitely
worse than as Spanish slaves; for in the one case
they had all the horrors of slavery without the name
or benefits, in the other the name without the
horrors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was congratulating himself on his good fortune,
and the prospect of making a safe and profitable
voyage, when the current of his thoughts
were changed by the appearance of a sail on his
weather bow. The sloop lost time by heaving-to,
to get in her boats, and was about ten miles astern;
and the strange sail was some six miles ahead,
standing to the northward and eastward, a course
that would bring her exactly across the schooner’s
track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take the glass, Mateo,” said Willis, “and jump
up on the fore-topsail yard, and see if you can make
out that chap ahead; he may be only some merchantman
after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mateo took the glass, and rapidly going aloft,
sung out in a voice of surprise—“Soul of my mother!
if it is not our old friend the Scorpion! who
must have a new captain, for you left the other past
service!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willis was at a loss how to act. If he kept on
he would meet the Scorpion, and the sloop behind
would soon be up, and then he would have them
both on him, and the brig alone was more than a
match for the Maraposa; eat them out of the wind
he could not, for they were both to windward of
him; to bear away dead before it was only the
same thing as keeping on, for both vessels, spreading
a great deal more canvas, would have outsailed
him, going with the wind over the tafferel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mateo, what do you think of the prospect?”
asked Willis of his mate, as he joined him on deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty squally, sir! we can’t run either way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! but we can keep on and fight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
“Yes, sir! but if the brig wings us, and we can
hardly expect to get off again with sound spars, we
will only fall into the clutches of the sloop, even if
we whip the brig.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the captain, “we can’t do any better,
and must make our wits help us. To begin with,
set the Portuguese flag, and let each man arm himself
with four pistols and a cutlas, and be ready to
obey orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vessels were rapidly approaching one another,
and the brig, getting within reach, fired. The
ball struck in the water so close to the schooner as
to cast the spray on her deck; but another shot
coming through the bulwarks, and lodging in the
heel of the bowsprit, Willis lowered his ensign, in
token of submission; and putting his helm up, lay-to,
by bringing the schooner in the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the ensign was lowered, the brig ceased
firing; and getting within hailing distance, an officer
on her forecastle, ordered the Maraposa to round-to
under her lee-quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay,” answered Willis, as he heard the order
given on board the brig to back the main-topsail.
Shoving his helm shear a-port, he brought the
schooner directly athwart the brig’s weather bow.
As soon as he heard the vessels grate, as they came
in contact, he sung out, “Away, ye butterflies!
away!” and springing up his own fore-rigging,
leaped, cutlas in hand, down on the deck of the
brig, followed by his whole crew, with the exception
of two or three, who remained behind to take charge
of the schooner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brig’s crew had not time to rally from the
surprise of this unexpected and desperate onslaught;
for the slavers rushed upon them with the ferocity
and vindictiveness of bloodhounds. Discharging
their pistols as they jumped on board, they threw
them at the heads of their foes, with wild yells, and
then, with boarding-axe and cutlas, they joined in
the deadly encounter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surprised by the suddenness of Willis’s attack,
and unprepared for it, the Englishmen gave back
before the impetuosity of his first burst, and he was
soon in possession of the forecastle; but, rallying in
the gangways, the slaughter on both sides was immense—hand
to hand, toe to toe, they fought; and
as a man on either side fell, another stepped into his
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shouts and huzzas that resounded from both
parties, at the commencement of the affray, had
now died away, and the only sounds heard were
the clink of steel, as their weapons came in contact,
or the sullen, dead sound of a boarding-axe, as it
crushed through a skull, and an occasional groan,
uttered by some poor fellow in his death-agony.
The termination of the conflict was doubtful, when
the state of affairs was altered, by an event equally
startling to both sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The negroes confined in the hold of the Maraposa,
frantic from their confinement and suffering, and
finding the crew had left her, succeeded in breaking
their bonds, and rushed on deck, wild with delight
at being loose, and burning for revenge, they threw
overboard the few men left in charge of the schooner,
and hearing the conflict on the brig, some sixty of
them, armed with handspikes, iron belaying-pins,
monkey-tails,<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> and whatever they could pick up,
came tumbling on board, and falling upon the rear
of the slavers, with unearthly and savage noises,
they threw them into great disorder, and created a
diversion in favor of the man-of-war’s men, which
they were not slow in taking advantage of, and
with a loud hurrah, they charged over the Maraposas,
and thought the day was already theirs; but the
negroes, who had only attacked the slavers because
they met them first as they came over the bow,
knew no difference in the white men; and as the
brig’s crew came within their reach, were assaulted
as fiercely as the slavers; and not until every
African had been slain, or forced overboard, was
the brig once more in the possession of her own
crew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Maraposa, after the men in charge of her
were thrown overboard, had forged clear of the
brig, and was now drifting about, sometimes with
her sails full, and then all aback, some quarter of a
mile off—the negroes dancing, jumping, and fighting
on her deck like a drove of monkeys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willis, who, looking around when the slaves first
fell upon his men to see what was the matter, had
received a severe blow on the back of his head
from a cutlas. His hat turning the edge, he was
only stunned by the force of the blow, and gradually
recovering his senses, he raised himself on his
elbow. At first his mind wandered, and he did not
recollect where he was; but soon the familiar faces
of many of his own men, and the bodies of the
English sailors who lay around him, covered with
ghastly wounds, and stiff in the cold embrace of
death; the groans of the wounded, as they were
borne past him, on their way to the cockpit, recalled
vividly to his imagination his melancholy
situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rising to his feet, and looking around, he found
that, for the present at least, his position was nearly
hopeless. Scarce half a dozen of his men had
escaped with life, his vessel out of his reach, and he
a prisoner to those from whom he did not expect
civil treatment; then with the certainty, nearly, of
the dangling noose, and foreyard-arm in the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few months previous it would have caused the
slaver’s captain not a moment’s uneasiness, had he
been in even a greater strait. If the gallows-rope
had been quivering over his head, its noose gaping
to receive his neck, it would not then have caused
a difference in his pulse, or a pang of sorrow in his
heart—for he was then both brave and reckless;
and knowing when he entered his present life that
the penalty was death, he would but have thought
the deal had been against him, the game lost, and
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
he, of course, must pay the stake. For what is life
worth without an aim—an object; living but to eat,
drink, and toil. With nothing to look forward to in
the future but a cessation from monotony, is worse
than death. And Willis, driven from the field of
honorable ambition, at enmity with his relations,
and loving or beloved by no one, had little to fear
from death or disgrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now, his feelings were altered. Love, that all
powerful passion, had brought about a change; not
that he now <span class='it'>feared</span> death, but the manner of it; and
the thought that the last Francisca would hear of
him, as the condemned felon, who had paid the
penalty of the law without even repenting of his
course, was harrowing. And he had thought, too,
that time, which brings about the most apparently
improbable things, might so arrange events, that he
would not always be the outcast he now was; and
even in the dim future he had pictured to himself
Francisca as being his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed, however, as if his course would now
soon be run, and his hopes blighted; and, steeped
in intense agony of mind, he was insensible to aught
around, when he was aroused by a rough grasp on
the shoulder, and a sailor asked if he was not the
captain of the schooner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered in the affirmative, and was told the
captain of the brig wished to see him. Following the
sailor, he was led to the cabin. Coming from the
light of the sun, it was comparatively dark, and at
first Willis did not observe that any one was in it;
but becoming accustomed to the light, he discovered
the figure of De Vere, pale and attenuated, lying on
a sofa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Willis was somewhat shocked; for he
thought that De Vere had been killed in the duel,
which belief was confirmed by not seeing him on
deck during the fight; but knowing, now, that he had
been only wounded, he quickly regained his look of
quiet composure, and fixing his eye on De Vere’s,
he stood silently before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A smile of gratified hatred was playing over De
Vere’s white face; and the sight of Willis, knowing
him to be completely in his power, seemed to afford
him so much pleasure, that, gloating on him with a
sparkling eye, he did not break the silence for some
moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You thought I was dead, did you, my noble captain?”
he at last said, in a satyrical tone; “but you
find I have life enough left yet to be at your hanging;
and I have a mind, for fear I should not, to have you
strung up now. Twice you have had the luck—the
third time is mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willis deigned not an answer; and with a curled
lip, expressive of his scorn, remained motionless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a short time the captain of the brig looked at
him in silence, and then, apparently overcome by
bodily fatigue, ordered Willis to be put in double
irons, which being put upon him at once, he was
carried on the berth-deck, and placed under the
charge of a sentinel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the wounded had been carried below,
the brig sent a prize crew on board the captured
slaver; and after a short struggle, they succeeded in
reducing her negroes to submission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the ship that had been chasing the
schooner, and whose boats had been repulsed in the
morning, came up, and proved to be the Vixen,
whose captain coming on board of the Scorpion, in
consequence of Capt. De Vere’s inability to leave
his cabin, and congratulated him on his good fortune
in capturing the Maraposa, ordered him to proceed
to Havana with the prize, and have her condemned,
and her crew, or what remained of them,
tried by the mixed commission;<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> and leaving them
to make the passage, we will return to where we
left De Vere, on the beach, after his duel with Willis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When De Vere’s second picked him up, he was
senseless; and his shirt, stained with blood on the
left breast, made him think he had been shot through
the heart. But the surgeon of the brig, who was in
attendance, examined him more closely, and found
that he had made a narrow escape; he was not mortally,
but still dangerously wounded; the ball had
struck directly over the heart, but taking a diagonal
direction, it had passed out under his arm, without
touching the seat of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carefully raising him, they carried him to the boat,
and supporting him on their knees, he was conveyed
to his vessel, then at anchor in the harbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Vere had promised to dine at Don Manuel’s
the day of the duel; and the old gentleman, surprised
at his absence—for he had always been most
punctual in keeping his appointments there—sent a
servant down to the brig to see if the captain was
unwell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man came hurrying back with a long, exaggerated
report of the affair, and said that “Captain
De Vere had been shot by a notorious slave captain;
and was dying, if not already dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alarmed at this information, the old gentleman
went at once to see De Vere; and finding he was
only badly wounded, by the consent of the physician,
had him removed from the brig to his own house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So occupied was Don Velasquez with attending
on the sick captain, that for a day or two he neglected
to call on “Brewster,” though he was constantly
endeavoring to think of some method by which he
could express the gratitude he felt for the preservation
of his beloved daughter; and he wondered why
“Brewster” had not again been to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the third day, however, his sense of duty not
permitting him longer to neglect one to whom he
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
was under such great obligations, he went out to
see the captain of the schooner, and was surprised
to find the vessel had left the port.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feeling vexed and mortified with himself that he
had not more promptly called upon “Brewster;”
and believing his unceremonious departure was occasioned
by his own lack of proper attentions, he
returned home, and told his daughters of the disappointment
he had met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara, whose pride was hurt, that one to whom
the family were indebted had been permitted thus
to depart, with the obligation unrequited, freely expressed
her sorrow. Francisca said very little,
nothing more than was absolutely necessary, but
felt far, far more than either of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pleased by the favorable impression Willis had
made upon Clara, and knowing that her father
would naturally feel kindly toward one who had
rendered her such valuable service, she had been
permitting herself to indulge in pleasant visions of
the future, in which she saw every thing “<span class='it'><a id='couleur'></a>couleur de
rose</span>,” and a happy consummation to her heart’s
passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These bright day-dreams were now all dispelled;
and with a sad heart she retired to the privacy of
her chamber, to mourn over her hard lot; for she
thought “if Brewster had cared any thing for me,
he would at least have said, adieu, before leaving,
perhaps for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Vere, knowing the obligations Don Velasquez
was under to Willis, had, from a gentlemanly feeling,
refrained from telling him that Captain “Brewster,
of the Portuguese navy,” was no other than Willis,
the notorious slaver, and the person who had so
nearly killed him; but when the old gentleman told
him of “Brewster’s” sudden departure, he apparently
suffered so much from mortification and self
reproach, that De Vere thought it would relieve his
mind to know the true character of the person in
whom he took so much interest; he therefore told
him, giving Willis, not his true character, but the
false one public report had fastened upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Manuel listened to this narrative with varying
emotions. At first he could not credit it, so
much was Willis’s appearance, manners, and air
<span class='it'>distingué</span>, at variance with his calling; but De Vere
insisted upon the correctness of his statement, and
then the Don was sorry, that one fitted to move in
so much more elevated a sphere, had no higher ambition
or aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the whole, however, Don Velasquez’s
wounded self-esteem was soothed; for though the
obligation was in reality the same as before, believing,
now, that Willis’s mind must necessarily be
sordid and base, he thought money would liquidate
the debt, and he would still have an opportunity of
acknowledging it. In the other case, with a high-minded
and gentlemanly man, as he had supposed
him to be, courtesies and attentions were the only
return he could have made; and to do this he had
lost the opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soothing his feelings, therefore, by resolving handsomely
to reward Willis, if ever he had the opportunity,
he determined to give himself no further
trouble about the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara, when she learned that “Brewster” had shot
De Vere, and was a negro trader, was loud in her
reproaches; and calling him many hard names,
wondered how he had the impudence to enter the
house of a gentleman, and congratulated her sister
upon her lucky escape, after being in the power of
such a wretch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Francisca, when she first heard the intelligence,
felt as if her heart had been shocked by an
earthquake; for it seemed as if an insurmountable
barrier had now been raised between her and Willis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>True to her woman’s heart, she still loved him as
much as ever, and would not believe the reports to
his detriment. She thought of him but as she had
known and seen him—kind, gentle, and noble; and
that if he was a slaver, it was not his own choice,
but the result of some dire necessity; and each time
she heard De Vere or her sister berate him, though
it deeply wounded her, it only made the remembrance
of him more dear; for she felt the slanders
were false. Silently, however, she bore her sorrows;
for, fearing to increase her sister’s animosity, she
never took the part of Willis when his name was
slurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old duenna was the only one that stood out
openly for the defamed Willis; she stoutly declared
“that Brewster, or Willis, slaver, or man-of-war, she
did not care which, he was the handsomest, the
most gentlemanly, and the kindest man she had ever
seen; and if ever she was in danger, she hoped he
might be near to protect her; and that it was a
shame for them thus to run him down behind his
back, when he saved Señorita Francisca’s life, to say
nothing of her own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Balm it was to Francisca, to hear the old lady
thus give utterance to the thoughts she did not dare
to speak; and in her daily orisons, regularly did she
supplicate the Virgin to protect the slaver’s captain,
and keep him in safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain De Vere’s wound, by assiduous nursing,
did not prove fatal; but his anxiety to be revenged
on Willis was so great, that before he was able to
leave his couch, and against the advice and entreaties
of Don Manuel, Clara, and the physician, he insisted
upon joining his vessel, and going to sea, with
the hope of capturing the Maraposa on her return
passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Scorpion and her prize had arrived safely in
Havana. Willis, heavily manacled, was brought on
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
deck, where, joined by the small remnant of his
crew, amongst whom he was glad to discover the
face of Mateo, though its symmetry had been spoiled
by a cutlas-cut, extending from under his right eye
to the left corner of his mouth, entirely severing the
end of his nose. The captain of the Maraposa was
kept a few moments waiting, and then, under a
strong guard, they were all carried to the Moro
Castle, and lodged in its dungeons, were left to
await their trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mateo and the rest of the men were put in a cell
together, Willis, for greater security, had been confined
in a strong apartment alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time the slaver had ever been in
prison, and the close, dank air, the gloom, the high,
dull, cold, stone walls, the heavy fetters upon his
limbs, the entire lack of any thing external to distract
his thoughts from his situation, all together,
produced a feeling of depression he had never
known before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus was he four days, with naught to while
away the time but his own thoughts, and they
brought any thing but comfort to his mind, for the
past scenes of a misspent life were constantly presenting
themselves with the vividness of a panorama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His early youth, when a good and gentle boy he
had listened to the kind admonitions of his excellent
mother; then the loss of his sweet parent, throwing
him amongst selfish and careless relations; his first
steps in vice; then his desire to repent and reform;
the cold looks and want of sympathy with which
he had been met; and bitterly cursing the want of
charity that had been so parsimonious of kindness,
when a few soothing words would have established
him in the road to rectitude, he looked at the darker
deeds of the few last years, and the end to which
they would soon bring him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harassed by such painful reflections, it was a relief
when the jailor came to conduct him to trial,
though he knew that with him the road would be
short from the tribunal to the gallows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt that his fate was sealed; he had mortified
De Vere so much, by dismantling his vessel and
killing so many of his men, besides wounding him
in the duel, that he knew the Englishman’s influence
would prevent his being treated with the least
leniency, and that the utmost penalty of the law
would be exacted. He lacked also that powerful
friend, gold. Aware of the uncertain tenure one in
his profession had of life, he squandered the immense
sums he made as he got them, and he had
not been allowed an opportunity of obtaining aid
from his associates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with a mind conscious of the worst, and
prepared to bear it, that with a calm, determined
countenance, and collected air, he was confronted
with his judges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The indictment was read, and the presiding judge
asked him if he was “Guilty, or not guilty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guilty I am!” said Willis, “as who that hears
me is not? but, that I am more worthy of condemnation
than even you, my judges, or than the accuser,
I deny! ’Tis true, I have been guilty of
bringing negroes from Africa to this island. But
wherein am I thereby more guilty than you? Do
you not eagerly buy them as soon as landed; and
so hold out the temptation to bring them? ’Tis
also true, that on the high sea I did, with force and
death, resist ‘her Britannic Majesty’s vessel.’ Were
moral right to prevail for once, her captain would
be in my situation; for by his intervention the
slaves that I would have brought here, to live in
comfort to a good old age, will now be condemned
to hard and short lives, as apprentices, in Brazil.
But what avails my talking! My life, I know, is
forfeited! and I will not degrade myself by making
useless efforts to save it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The counts in the indictment were all sustained.
After a short consultation, he was adjudged to die.
And standing up to hear his sentence, he found he
was to be hung, the day after the morrow, to the
fore-yard of his own vessel. He then was carried
back to his dungeon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the captain had been sentenced, the rest of
the crew were brought up for trial; but being all
men of little notoriety, and pleading their necessity
to obey the commands of Willis, and that when they
had joined the Maraposa they did not know she
was a slaver, they were all pardoned except Mateo,
who was compelled to pay a fine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Vere, after the trial, returned home exultingly;
the man that had caused him to be laughed at by
the whole squadron, the one who had nearly killed
him, and again came within an ace of capturing his
brig, was about to be punished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara was likewise glad to hear of Willis’s fate,
for she hated him for wounding her betrothed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Don Manuel learned the result of the trial
with sadness; he had tried to prevail upon De Vere
not to prosecute, but the Englishman said it was
impossible; his sense of justice, his oath and honor
as an officer, all, he contended, compelled him to
have the law enforced; he had even made an effort
to influence the court, but found De Vere’s influence
governed them all; he had not, however, given up
all hope yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well was it for the secret of Francisca’s heart
that the sentence of Willis was conveyed to her in
her own chamber, by the faithful duenna, for as soon
as she heard the awful news she sunk senseless on
the floor; swoon succeeded swoon for some time,
but recovering, in a degree, her composure, her eye
brightened and her cheek flushed, as if some happy
idea had flashed across her mind, and leaving the
room she sought her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the night after the day of the trial, the bells
of the many churches had just ceased chiming ten,
when the silence that reigned in the slaver’s cell
was broken by the sound of a key grating in the
lock of his door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surprised at having a visiter at so unusual an
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
hour, Willis turned to see why he was disturbed,
and was astonished to discover, as the door opened,
by the light in the hands of the jailor, who remained
in the passage, a female figure, closely enveloped
in the folds of a large mantilla, glide into his dungeon.
When within a few feet of Willis, the lady paused,
and, save the convulsive motion of her breast,
stood for a moment motionless. Then, slowly dropping
the mantilla from about her face, she revealed
to the startled gaze of the prisoner the features of
Francisca, not as he had seen them, but pale as
death, and thin, as if she had lately been very ill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willis was about to speak, but raising her finger
as a sign for him to be silent, she said —</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time is precious, Captain Willis, waste it not
in inquiries or conjectures of the cause of my being
here, but believe that I am deeply grateful for the
life I owe you, and am desirous of repaying it in
kind. Every exertion has been made without success
by my father to procure your pardon, but my
efforts have been more blessed. In two hours the
turnkey, who has been bribed, will let you out;
proceed to the nearest quay, where you will find all
that is left of your crew, waiting for you in a boat;
take them to your schooner, which is at anchor in
the same place she was when you were brought
here; the few men in charge of her have also been
bought; and then to make your way out safely will
have to depend upon yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Willis endeavored to speak, and express
his thanks, but Francisca motioned him to hush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One moment more, and I must be gone. In this
package,” she handed him a small bundle, apparently
of paper, “you will find that which will be
useful to you, if you get to sea. And praying that
the blessed Virgin will protect you, I wish you God
speed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned, and was going, but Willis seized her
hand for an instant, and imprinting upon it a kiss,
said, in a voice tremulous with emotion,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The gratitude I feel, lady, after years shall
prove;” and letting her hand go she vanished, and
the door shutting, Willis was again in the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had it not been for the palpable evidence of the
package, still in his hand, he would have thought
the interview had been a dream; as it was, he
could hardly convince himself it was aught else.
So sudden had been the entrance of Francisca, she
had looked so much an angel, so quickly vanished,
that the two hours had elapsed before he was really
certain he had not been only blest by a vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the noiseless entry of the turnkey established
the fact of mortal agency. And his fetters being
unlocked, he once more was comparatively free.
With deep feelings of gratitude and love toward
Francisca, for her noble conduct, he left his cell,
and in silence followed the unechoing steps of his
former jailor, through many long passages and
winding ways that led at last to a small private
door, built in the outer wall, opening toward the
harbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Willis paused, to bid his conductor good-night,
and thank him. But the man said his life
would not be worth an hour’s purchase if he were
found there in the morning, and he had been paid
well enough to leave his situation, and that if el
Señor Capitan had no objection, he would go with
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willis of course could not have refused; but he
had no such intention; and knowing the sparseness
of his crew, was very glad thus to obtain another
able-bodied man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much pleased at the captain’s ready acquiescence,
the obliging turnkey locked the door on the outside,
and put the key in his pocket, saying he never liked
to part with old friends, and it might be of use to
him again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quietly continuing their way, Willis and his quondam
jailor walked out to the extremity of the nearest
quay, where, in a boat laying close in the shadow
of the wharf, he found Mateo and the remnant of
his former crew. Brief, but cordial, were the greetings
that passed between the slavers and their recovered
captain, who, telling them how much he
was indebted to his companion, stepped with him
into the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was dark; thick clouds of misty vapor
obscuring the light of the stars; and every thing
seemed to be slumbering; even the “alerto sentinelo”
of the guards on the castle, and in the city, as
it broke the silence, had a sleepy sound; and the
safety with which the boat shoved off and pulled
into the basin proved they were not very wide
awake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tall masts of the Maraposa were dimly seen
by Willis, as his boat, slowly and with muffled oars,
made toward her, and the ebb tide was running out
with all its force by the time he was alongside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who comes there?” some one hailed, in a
stifled voice, from the schooner, as the bow of the
boat slightly touched her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friends!” was Willis’s reply, and with the
celerity and noiseless tread of Indian warriors, he
and his boat’s crew transferred themselves to the
deck of the schooner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the foot of Willis once more pressed his own
quarter-deck he seemed a new being, and felt as if
he were already safe, but a glance at the dark pile
of the Moro, and the black hull of the Scorpion, just
visible in the haze behind him, reminded him of the
dangers still to be overcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silently! silently, men! on your lives!” he
whispered; “put the helm hard a-port, one of you!
and, Mateo, forward and slip the cable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the silence of men who knew their lives
depended on their quietness, but with the dispatch
engendered by long habit, his orders were obeyed,
and the schooner forced from her anchor, swung
round with the tide and began to drift toward the
sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a word was spoken, or a foot moved; had
the vessel been unmanned, until the castle had been
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
passed, she could not have been more silent; unchallenged
she floated on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So excited and alert were the organs of her men,
however, that when Willis ordered them to hoist
away the jib, though speaking in a low tone, it caused
them all to start. The jib greatly increased the
Maraposa’s way through the water; and as soon as
he thought it would not excite the attention of the
sentinels at the castle, he hoisted his main-sail and
fore-sail, loosing his square-sails quietly, the yards
rose to their places, and in half an hour more the
gallant schooner, under all sail, was standing out
to sea. With a wild huzza, the crew gave vent
to their feelings, and Willis, rejoiced to be again at
liberty, and in safety, could not help joining them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon examining the state of his vessel, which
he did at once, he was gratified to find every thing
undisturbed in the hold—all the provisions and
water were still in her—the powder had not even
been removed from the magazine, and the only
things missing were the schooner’s papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His crew, indeed, instead of numbering fifty men,
as it had, now only mustered ten beside himself—Mateo,
and his six companions, with the two men
who had been in charge of the Maraposa, and the
turnkey. Though too few to fight with, they were
amply sufficient to manage the vessel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The course he intended ultimately to pursue
Willis had not yet decided. The first and most imperative
object was to get beyond the reach of pursuit;
and leaving Mateo in charge of the deck, with
directions to steer to the eastward, and to call him
if he saw a sail, he descended to the cabin, to reflect
on the eventful changes of the last few hours, and
think about his future line of conduct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first thing that attracted his attention, when
he entered the cabin, was a small, strong wooden
box, well secured with cords, setting on the table.
Never having seen it before, and curious to know
why it was so carefully fastened, he approached the
table, and with surprise discovered the box was
directed to “Captain Willis, of the Maraposa.”
Hastily undoing the rope that bound it, and lifting
the lid, he found the box full of Spanish doubloons,
and a note, likewise endorsed with his name, lying
on the top of them. Opening it, he read —</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—Having in vain endeavored to find some
other method by which I could testify the gratitude
I feel to the preserver of my beloved Francisca, I
hope you will accept of the enclosed contents, as a
slight evidence of the obligation I feel; and sincerely
desiring it may prove useful, I have the honor to be,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;'>“Very respectfully,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>“<span class='sc'>Manuel Velasquez</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Willis was mortified to think the old Spaniard
believed he was actuated by any hope of gain when
he saved Francisca; and had he been able, would
at once have returned him the money. But, situated
as he now was, to return it at once was impossible.
So, replacing the cover on the box, and putting it in
his chest, he took from his breast the package given
him by Francisca in the dungeon, which his constant
occupation had prevented him as yet from
examining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Undoing the wrapper, he found the bundle contained
nothing but Portuguese papers, regularly
authenticated for a vessel exactly of the size and
build of the Maraposa. In vain he looked amongst
their folds, and on them, for a note, or even a line,
from the fair donor, but nothing of the kind was to
be seen; and disappointed, he scarce knew why,
for he had not the slightest reason to expect any
thing of the kind, he sat down by the cabin table,
and with his face buried in his hands, the following
thoughts, reflections, and resolutions, passed through
his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time the image of Francisca usurped
his thoughts. He felt confident she took a more
tender interest in his welfare than she had expressed;
for there is a species of clairvoyance in love, that
enables one to see things that are meant to be hidden;
and though gratitude had been assigned as the
cause of her efforts in delivering him from death, he
believed it was only an excuse, and his heart
warmed with love as he thought of her. With the
long frozen springs of his better feelings thus thawed
by tender sentiments, the kind and impressive lessons
of virtue that had been inculcated by his departed
mother, and which had been allowed to
slumber in forgetfulness for many years, now all
distinctly and forcibly presented themselves; and
the hardened slaver, the stern man, shed bitter
tears, as he thought of the happy days of his youth,
and the slight regard he had paid to the teachings
of his once dearly loved parent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed as if a veil had been removed from his
sight; and he now saw, in all its deformity, his present
course of life, and the desire became strong
within him to reform. He now had an object to
strive for—the possession of Francisca’s love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But how was he to begin? All he possessed in
the world was his vessel, and the money on board
of Don Manuel’s. He could not hope to win the
consent of the proud Spaniard, even if his daughter
was willing, while he was poor. He knew no profession
but that of ploughing the deep; and as
merchant captain, who would employ him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short time longer he sat, and then rising, spoke
aloud. “I cannot reform yet; one more voyage I
must make—one more voyage in the slave-trade.
I will use the old Spaniard’s money to buy a new
cargo, sell it, and repay his doubloons; and with the
capital remaining I will begin a new and honorable
career, and win, spite of all opposition, the hand of
Francisca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following morning the sentinel on the forecastle
of the Scorpion was the first one who discovered
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
the disappearance of the captured slaver.
Looking in the direction the schooner had been the
evening before, he missed her. As it was hardly
light, he thought the fog must have hidden the
vessel; but it cleared away, and still nothing was to
be seen of her. Rubbing his eyes, to be sure he was
awake, he took a long and careful survey of the
harbor, but without finding any traces of the object
of his search, and hastening to the officer of the
deck, he reported the news of the Maraposa’s departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer of the deck, equally astonished,
hastened to let the first lieutenant know of the
strange event; for they were all concerned in the
loss of the schooner, as the price she would have
sold for was to be divided amongst the brig’s crew
as prize money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a boat called away, and getting into it,
was rowed over to the castle, to see if he could
hear any thing of the missing vessel there; but instead
of getting information, found the whole garrison
in a state of excitement at the unaccountable
events of the night—Willis and the turnkey having
just been missed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the lieutenant of the brig learned of
Willis’s escape, he very readily and truly conjectured
the whereabouts of the schooner; and knowing
it would be useless to seek her in the harbor,
went ashore to inform his captain that Willis and
the Maraposa had both again escaped, and were
probably on their way back to the coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This intelligence, like that of the trial, affected
the members of Don Manuel’s family differently.
De Vere was very angry, and would have gone to
sea at once, and chased Willis to Africa; but Clara
made him promise he would not go more than fifty
or sixty miles; and if he did not meet him, then to
return, as it was not to be very long ere their
nuptial day. De Vere agreed to gratify his lady
love; and after taking a short cruise, returned without
having seen any thing of the Maraposa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara comforted him on his return, by telling him
Willis would live to be hung yet, a notion that the
old duenna vigorously opposed, and contended that
“the handsome captain of the slaver would die in
his bed, in spite of all the navy officers on the station;”
for, for some reason, the members of the R. N. were
no favorites with the old lady. Don Manuel was
more than pleased to hear of Willis’s escape, and
expressed a hope that the warning he had received
might be the means of reforming him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Francisca was overjoyed, and did nothing
but offer up thanks to the Virgin the remainder of
the day; and she also prayed fervently that Willis
might embrace some less dangerous and more
honorable pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Vere, feeling assured that Willis had escaped
by the agency of some one in the city or
castle, and anxious to have them punished, made
every exertion to discover who they were. He
had some suspicion of Don Manuel; but all his
efforts to get any clue from the Spaniard were unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He complained to the Governor-General of the
Island, and had all the garrison of the castle, from
the commander down, rigorously examined. But
it was all of no avail; the only person who could be
charged with conniving at Willis’s escape, or in any
way aiding him, was the jailor who had him in
charge; and their efforts to retake him proved as
futile as to find the captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Vere could comfort himself in no other way,
and therefore made a mental resolve to hang Willis
at once, if he ever was so fortunate as to get possession
of him again, and leave him no chance for
another escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the last chapter but one, we left Willis on his
way once more to the coast of Africa. We will
now join him, as he is about starting back for Cuba,
with a cargo of negroes, purchased with the money
Don Manuel had sent him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His crew being too small to do any thing more
than navigate the schooner; and having been unable,
on the coast, to increase their number, he had, prior
to taking in his cargo, dismounted his guns, and
stowed them, with their carriages, in the hold, under
the ballast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This change of weight he now found altered much
and greatly retarded the schooner’s speed; but it
was now too late to make any alterations; and it
was with greater anxiety than he had ever felt on
any former voyage that he looked out for men-of-war.
He could neither fight, nor confidently trust to his
vessel’s speed; and he was particularly anxious to
get in safely with this, if he could land them, his last
cargo of Africans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The schooner was within ten days of making land,
and had not seen a vessel. All hands were congratulating
themselves on their good fortune, when,
far astern, and to windward, a sail was discovered
just on the verge of the horizon. It did not appear
larger than a speck, and to any but most practiced
eyes, would have been invisible. Had the Maraposa
been in her usual trim, they never would have
had a clearer view of the stranger; but now, to
Willis’s mortification, the distant vessel gradually
became visible; first the royals were seen, then her
topgallant-sails, and in three hours they could even
make out the head of her courses; enough to confirm
the feet of her being a man-of-war, and she
gaining rapidly on the schooner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though in consequence of the Maraposa’s being
so much smaller, it was not probable that the stranger
had yet observed her, but was only steering in
the same direction. But Willis knew that if he
had not yet been seen, if the distance was still
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
lessened, he could not escape, and it behooved him
to increase his speed by all means, and avoid being
chased. Captured he had sworn never again to be,
let the consequences be what they might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How to accelerate the Maraposa’s way was a
question of some difficulty. Already was every
stitch of canvas that would draw, and some that did
not, set; and there was nothing on deck he could
throw over to lighten his vessel, except his anchor
and cable; as the other had been left in the harbor
at Havana, she had but one; the guns he could not
get at, covered as they were by the ballast and provisions
in the hold; and feeling uncertain how to
act, he called his mate to him to get his opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mateo, this is the squalliest prospect we
have ever had, and the first time we could neither
fight or run. What do you think we had better do?
That fellow astern will be down on us before night,
unless we can get along faster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sir, the only way we can make the
Butterfly fly faster, is by taking some of the load off
of her; and there is only two ways we can do that—and
it will have to be done quickly to be of any
avail—for that chap astern is coming along as if he
carried a tornado with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can we start over to lighten her?” asked
Willis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why nothing but the niggers, or the water—either
of them would do it. Those ten pipes of
water, if they were overboard, would let the schooner
along as she used to go; but without the water the
niggers would die. So that I think, sir, we had
better heave over half the niggers, and half of the
water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This the mate said with as much nonchalance as
if he had been recommending the drowning of a
score of hogs; for he had been engaged in the slave-trade
for many years, and had learned to regard
negroes, not as human beings, but as he would any
other species of merchandize with which the vessel
might be loaded. And as to his thinking it murder,
or a sin to kill a “woolly-head,” as he called them,
it never entered his mind, and he would have jerked
the whole lot overboard, had it been necessary for
his own safety, with as little compunction as he
would so much old junk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Willis’s mind had been too much under the
influence of better feelings, for the last few weeks,
to think of drowning in cold blood, one hundred and
fifty mortals, if they were black, to save his own
life; he therefore resumed the conversation with
Mateo by saying, —</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it will be a chance if we don’t lose all
the negroes if we start over the water, but I cannot
think of drowning the poor devils; so they will have
to take their chance of dying with thirst, and you
must start over all the water but one pipe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The water was in large pipes, some lashed amid-ships,
abaft the fore-mast, some on the quarter-deck,
and a couple on the forecastle. The casks being
unlashed, and the bungs turned down, soon emptied
themselves of their contents, and the schooner
sprung forward as if she felt the relief, and was soon
speeding along at her old rate of sailing, which by
the next morning had left the strange sail so far
astern that she was out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though he had succeeded in eluding pursuit,
Willis’s troubles still came thick upon him. The
cask of water that had been left was the one from
which they had already used, and it was found to
have not more than sixty gallons of water in it to
last over three hundred men ten days, in the heat
of the tropics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willis called up his crew and proposed dividing
it out equally amongst all hands, negroes and all, and
then there would have been hardly a gill a day for
each man, but enough to sustain life. The men
would not hearken to him, swore they were not
going to be put on such short allowance for the
sake of the d—d niggers; and said if there was not
enough to go round, to throw the blackbirds into
the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willis, by persuasion, at last succeeded in getting
his men to agree to be allowanced to half a pint of
water per diem, and let him portion the rest out to
the negroes as he chose. This he did impartially,
as far as it went; but the quantity was so small that
the slaves, confined as they were constantly in the
hold, on account of the smallness of the crew, could
not exist upon it—and the hold of the slaver became
a perfect pandemonium. Daily the poor
Africans were attacked with brain fever, and, perfectly
crazy, would shout, yell, cry, sing, and shuffle
about as well as their fetters would permit, until
they were relieved by death; and so many died
each day, that the whole crew were kept busy
getting them out of the hold, and heaving them into
the ocean. Ere land was made, the last of the
three hundred were dead; and Willis, putting into
the first bay he came to on the coast to re-water,
was worse off than when he started for Africa,
having made nothing, and spent all the money
given him by Don Manuel, and which he wished to
repay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hopes of being able to quit the traffic, which
was now becoming odious to him, were thus deferred;
for the money he had used, and which he
was most anxious to refund, was an additional
argument in his mind for taking another voyage to
the coast; and hoping it would prove more profitable,
and enable him to quit the trade then forever,
he made sail again, and running into the same
river in which we first found the Maraposa, he left
her there, in the charge of Mateo, and disguising
himself, for fear of being recognized by De Vere,
Don Manuel, or Francisca, he proceeded by land to
Havana, for the purpose of increasing his crew, and
obtaining funds from some of his friends to enable
him to get another cargo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few days he had been able, by constant exertion,
to enlist from amongst the numerous desperadoes
that are ever to be found in Havana, forty
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
new men, nearly all good sailors. The bravery and
skill of Willis being well known amongst the merchants
who were engaged in the slave-trade, he
found no difficulty in borrowing from them the
amount of money he wanted, on the security of the
cargo he was going to bring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day he was to leave Havana, Willis was
strolling along the streets, and accidentally came in
sight of the Cathedral. Before the entrance were
numerous carriages drawn up, the splendor of the
equipages, and the bridal favors with which the servants
and horses were decked, were evidence that
the nuptial knot was being tied in the church between
some of the magnates of the city; and having
nothing else to engage his attention, Willis walked
in to witness the ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entering the spacious temple, he saw in front of
the high altar, a large and brilliant group of elegantly
attired gentlemen, and magnificently dressed ladies,
in attendance on the couple whom the priest was
just in the act of joining together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the door, the air and figures of the principal
persons seemed familiar to him. Keeping in the
shade of the pillars that ran along the side aisle, he
approached nearer, and discovered in the bride and
bridegroom, Clara and De Vere. He gave them but
a glance, for just behind them, and leaning on the
arm of her father, he saw Francisca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lovely she looked—more lovely than he had ever
seen her; but the brilliancy of her glorious black
eye contrasted strangely with the deathly pallor of
her cheek, and her thoughts seemed far away from
the scene before her; and Willis, during the ceremony,
intently watching her, hoped the next time
they met before the altar, it might be to claim her
as his bride, and wondered if that distracted air
with which Francisca regarded the passing event
was at all occasioned by thoughts of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara was beautiful—proudly, haughtily beautiful;
and a smile of gratified pride lighted her face as she
surveyed the surrounding throng, and felt herself
the most brilliant and beautiful of the group. De
Vere seemed proud of his haughty beauty, and Don
Manuel appeared perfectly contented, and felt assured
that he was consulting his daughter’s happiness
by consenting to her marriage with the
Englishman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willis had not, however, wasted a glance on
them; concealed by the column near which he was
standing, he had feasted his eyes on Francisca; and
when, after the benediction, the party moved away,
he still continued to gaze on the spot where she
had been. The noise made by their carriages, as they
rolled away, aroused him, and he left the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gathering up his new men at nightfall, he returned
to his vessel, to which he had already sent provisions.
Hard all that night did they work, getting
up and remounting the guns; and the next morning,
as the Maraposa went to sea, she was again the
same looking craft that she was when we first saw
her leaving the cove, both beautiful and dangerous,
with her guns all ready for use, and a large crew to
handle them; and leaving her to make her last
voyage to the coast, in the capacity of a slaver, let
us rejoin De Vere and his new bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Bravo</span>! bravo!” exclaimed the delighted Mons.
Lunoyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful! exquisitely graceful!” repeated the
young ladies that filled the dancing room, as Therese
Wilson, a fine looking girl of fourteen or fifteen,
went through a fashionable dance with Harry Belton,
a handsome youth near the same age. It was the
“practicing afternoon” of the young ladies belonging
to Madame Chalon’s fashionable boarding-school—and
a pretty sight was Mons. Lunoyer’s rooms on
those afternoons. Stylish-looking girls of all ages,
from the dainty little miss, just lisping her French
phrases, up to the dashing school-belle, just on the
eve of making her entrée into “<span class='it'>society</span>,” panting for
the heart-conquests her imagination pictured forth
in her future. And right lucky were those youths,
who, having sisters, or sweet pets of cousins at the
school, were permitted by Madame Chalon to take
part in these practicings—a privilege which caused
many an envious thought to their less favored
school-fellows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the close of the dance the beautiful Therese
approached her young companions, with cheeks
glowing, and young heart beating high with gratified
pride. What more could her girlish ambition
desire? Harry Belton, the favorite beau of the
school, stood by her, fanning her, and saying a
thousand pretty things, while the young ladies, her
class-mates, looked on. The dance had been performed
with grace and beauty; and every one in
the room expressed aloud their admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See, Therese,” said a little girl, anxious to attract
the attention of the envied school-belle, “see what
wonders your lovely dancing has performed; the
little cry-baby creole, Cora Neill, has quite forgotten
her tears; and her nurse, Rita, will tell you she has
done nothing but weep since she left her father’s
plantation up to this moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therese shook back her curls carelessly, without
deigning to notice the compliment intended to be
conveyed; but Harry Belton instantly turned his
eyes toward the poor little Cora. The child was,
indeed, lost in admiration. She leaned her tiny
form against her black nurse, while her large, dark
eyes, swollen with incessant weeping, flashed
brightly, as they met the boy’s inquiring gaze. She
seized his hand with childish earnestness, and exclaimed
in Spanish, “<span class='it'>Ah venga danza vmd. conmigo?</span>”
“Ah, come, dance with me,” and raising
herself, her little feet went quickly over the first
movements of the dance. The young girls surrounding
Therese, seeing her smile contemptuously,
laughed aloud at what they called the child’s presumption.
Poor Cora stopped suddenly as she
heard their laughter, then, with a burst of passionate
tears, she hid her little head on her nurse’s shoulder.
The indignant nurse poured out in a breath, soothings
to her darling, and invectives upon the young
ladies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor child!” said Harry. “You must not be so
angry. Pray, stop weeping—do you not know you
are to be my little dancing partner? Come, Cora,
show these doubting young ladies how well you can
dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the child could hardly understand his
imperfect Spanish, still she gathered sufficient from
his tone of voice to know that he intended kindness.
Gradually he succeeded in persuading her to leave
nurse Rita’s shoulder, and obtaining permission from
the dancing-master, he gave orders to the musicians
to repeat the dance. At the introduction of the air,
little Cora’s eyes flashed, and <span class='it'>she</span> seemed to forget
all cause of discontent and sorrow. The dance
proceeded, and those who had looked on at first
from mere curiosity, found themselves applauding
quite as much as they had a little while before the
graceful execution of Therese. The floating, airy
figure of the child, gave her a sylph-like appearance;
and as she entered into the spirit of the dance, her
dark cheeks glowed, and full lips seemed still redder;
and then her bright eyes beamed forth such a childish
lovingness in the concluding waltz movement, that
quite bewitched them all. Mons. Lunoyer complimented
her, and the young ladies pronounced her
a “little love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who taught you to dance so prettily, Cora?”
asked Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The large eyes of the child again filled with tears,
for the question carried her childish memory back
to her island home, and the happy days when her
mother, now no longer living, had taken delight in
teaching her graceful child the dances she herself
excelled in. Her sobbings commenced anew, and
with agonizing exclamations she begged her dear
Rita to take her to her own <span class='it'>guerida madre</span>. Harry
assisted the nurse in soothing the unhappy little
creature, while the rest of the school joined in the
concluding dance. After it was finished, the attendant
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
governess gave the signal for departure. The
little weeping Cora clung to her nurse as her only
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Adios mi queridita Cora</span>,” said Harry, as he
stooped down his tall, graceful, though boyish form,
and looked affectionately <a id='into'></a>into her dark eyes. She
brightened as she saw his kind, brotherly look, and
with bewitching <span class='it'>naïveté</span> held up her pretty, cherry
lips to kiss him. The boy blushingly caressed her,
and drove away his confusion by teaching her to
call him in English her “dear brother Harry,”
telling her she should be his own <span class='it'>querida hermana</span>.
His <a id='kind'></a>kind words comforted her, and with the happy
forgetfulness of childhood, she laughed aloud merrily,
as she repeated after him, “dear brother Harry;”
then, after caressing adieus to her adopted brother,
she accompanied Rita and the governess to her new
home, happier than she had been since her mother’s
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cora Neill was the daughter of an Irish gentleman
who had resided at Havana for many years.
There he had married a young and lovely girl
belonging to one of the resident Spanish families.
Many beautiful children had his gentle wife borne
him, but one after another had bowed their little
heads like drooping blossoms, and had been laid in
the grave. At last the little Cora alone remained
to them—the idol of both mother and father.
Scarcely had she passed the age of infancy, when her
beautiful mother’s cheeks glowed with a hectic flush,
and her eyes burned with unnatural lustre. Poor
Cora was but eight years of age when her mother
was laid down to rest beside her other children.
A year or two passed, and the bereaved father endeavored
to soothe his grief in the caresses of his
daughter. At last, when he reflected how unable
he was to give her those advantages of education
she needed, he resolved, though with a severe
struggle, to part with her for a few years, and
accordingly sent her to Madame Chalon’s establishment
in one of the large Atlantic cities of the United
States. She had only arrived a few days previous
to the dancing lesson, and her poor little aching
heart had throbbed with intense agony when she
found herself surrounded by strangers. True, she
had her black nurse, Rita, with her, and in the old
woman’s nursery soothings she sometimes forgot her
troubles; but there were moments when even the
good old nurse failed to quiet her, and the poor little
Cora refused to be comforted. But from the day
when Harry plighted to her his brotherly faith, the
school-home seemed more bearable. All in the
establishment became interested in the little West
Indian, and she seemed in a fair way to be spoiled;
even the vain Therese was seen to caress her.
The dancing <span class='it'>reunions</span>, as they came around weekly,
were bright suns in her existence; for then she met
again with Harry, and again renewed their brother
and sister troth. Two or three years floated sunnily
by, when her first unhappiness was caused by
Harry’s receiving a summons from his Southern
home. They parted at Mons. Dunoyer’s rooms on
one of the practicing <span class='it'>reunions</span>, where they had first
met. All the girls, and even the assistant governesses
sympathized with little Cora; and she was
permitted to converse apart with him at this sad
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not forget me, Cora,” said the boy, as he
affectionately wound his arm around the tearful
girl. “When I grow to be a man, I will visit your
beautiful island, and you shall introduce your brother
Harry to his sister Cora’s father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With renewed protestations of constancy the
children parted.</p>

<hr class='tbk106'/>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Chalon’s fine house was brilliantly
lighted; carriages were rolling to and from the door;
the sound of gay music could be heard by the
passers-by; and from the large balconied windows
of the drawing-rooms might be seen, group after
group of gayly dressed women, and <span class='it'>distingué</span> looking
men in the promenade. The elegant and courteous
lady of the mansion was receiving her dear
five hundred friends at one of her annual balls,
given to introduce the young ladies who had
finished the course of studies at her school into
general society. Delighted and satisfied, she moved
quietly and smilingly through her rooms, receiving
her friends, and superintending her young <span class='it'>élèves</span>.
Every thing was as it should be—the most fastidious
could not fail to be satisfied, either as they looked
at the tasteful decorations of the rooms, the entertainment,
the music, or the guests; therefore, knowing
all this, Madame Chalon’s heart was at rest.
Of her young ladies who were at this season making
their <span class='it'>entrée</span> into the fashionable world under her
auspices, Cora Neill created the greatest sensation;
and even in such an assemblage of beauty as was
here on this night, she was universally admitted to
be the belle of the room. Years had rolled by since
she had first entered the school—years, which had
changed her into a beautiful, accomplished woman.
Her docility of disposition, her winning manners,
and quickness of intellect, had endeared her to the
governesses and pupils; and her approaching departure
from the school, which was to take place
in a few months, at the close of the season, was
looked forward to by them with great regret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cora had just finished a dance, when Madame
Chalon came up to her, leaning on the arm of a
gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allow me, my dear,” she said, “to recall to your
memory a friend of your little girlhood. He was
too timid to trust to your recollection. I need not
call him Mr. Belton—you already remember him, I
am sure, although the years that have passed since
you met, have changed you both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rich color mounted to Cora’s cheeks, and her
dark eyes flashed with pleasure as, with a frank expression
of joyful greeting, she extended her hand
to her old playmate. They had not met since
Harry had been summoned home, years before, to
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
attend the death-bed of his mother. Shortly after that
sad event he had entered the navy, and had passed
from boyhood to manhood. He often thought of the
little West Indian, Cora Neill. Her sweet winning
ways would come before him in his lonely night-watches,
and her graceful, floating form would be
recalled to his memory, when in southern climes
he would bear through the voluptuous waltz some
brilliant maiden. But only as <span class='it'>little</span> Cora had he
thought of her; and when he saw her at Madame
Chalon’s ball, so dazzlingly beautiful, instead of renewing
instantly, as was his intention, their old
friendship, he hesitated, and at last called on the
Madame to present him; but Cora’s frank manner
threw aside all reserve, and they were in a little
while waltzing and talking, as they had years before
at Mons. Dunoyer’s <span class='it'>reunions</span>. The following day
found him a visiter at the Madame’s; and as his
sisters had been favorite pupils of hers, he was
greeted with a pleasant welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Cora’s first winter in society, and under
Madame Chalon’s <span class='it'>chaperonage</span> she frequented all the
gay resorts of the fashionable world. Beautiful, and
a reputed heiress, of course, she was a belle; but
prominent amongst her admirers was the young
lieutenant. It was not long before they made the
mutual discovery of their love for each other—and
they both yielded themselves without reflection to
this first love. They dreamed only of happiness,
and fondly imagined no clouds could hang over
their future. Madame Chalon was finally consulted
by both, and she enclosed in a letter of her own,
Harry Belton’s application for Cora’s hand to Mr.
Neill. The hours floated joyously by, and Cora
thought life increased in beauty daily, when all her
rosy dreams were dispelled, and she rendered
miserable by the receipt of three letters from her
father. One contained a brief, polite dismissal to Mr.
Belton. The second was a civil acknowledgment
to Madame Chalon for her kind care of his daughter
for so many years, and a request that she should
prepare Cora to accompany some West India
friends, then traveling in the United States, who, in
the following month, were to return to Cuba, and
would take charge of her. The third was a letter
to Cora—not a severe, upbraiding one, but one
filled with sorrowful lovingness and fatherly entreaties.
He pictured his solitary life since her mother’s
death; how earnestly he had devoted himself to
business, that he might accumulate enough to lavish
freely on her, his only one, every luxury, when she
should be old enough to take her mother’s place.
He described the day-dreams he had indulged of an
old age that was to be cheered by his only child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, my own idolized girl,” he wrote, at the
conclusion of his letter, “that I am submitting myself
to the imputation of selfishness; but when you
reflect upon my past desolate life, and my future,
you will pardon, I am sure, this selfishness. I am
an old man, Cora; I need kindness, nursing, and
love—I pine for a daughter’s care. Many years,
have elapsed since your blessed mother’s death;
and I might have, with propriety, married again, in
order to guard against a lonely old age. Regard
for her memory, and for your future prospects,
Cora, have deterred me from taking this step. I
have submitted willingly to the penance of a solitary
life, when I reflected it was for the mental benefit
of my daughter, comforting my weary hours by
looking forward to the period when we should be
again united. Your letters, heretofore, have been
filled with affection for me, and a similar desire
for this reunion. Come to me, my Cora—come to
your old solitary father, who needs your society.
Let not a stranger usurp my place in the heart of
my only, my idolized child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cora shed bitter tears on reading this letter, but
her heart was filled with sad reproaches. Her
memory reverted to the days of her childhood, when
her mother and father watched over her with fondness.
She recalled the agonizing moments that
followed her mother’s death, when no one was permitted
to approach her father but herself. She remembered
the intense look of devotion with which
he used always to regard her; and then she thought
of the solitary, unhappy years that he must have
passed while she, with the unthinking spirit of
youth, had been seeking happiness for herself, independent
of the kind, old, forsaken father, who had
no one on earth to love but her. In vain were
Harry’s entreaties, or Madame Chalon’s proffers of
assistance and interference. She resolved, though
with a sad, aching heart, to renounce all expectation
of ever marrying Harry, and made preparations
for her departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me some period to look forward to, Cora,”
was her lover’s last entreaty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot, Harry,” she replied, “henceforth I belong
only to my father; I never shall marry so long
as he lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will you forget me?” exclaimed her lover,
passionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears of reproach started to Cora’s eyes as he
asked this angry question, but she refrained from
assurances to the contrary. “Forget me, dear
Harry,” she said, so soon as she had mastered her
emotion. “It will be better for us both; my duty
lies in a different path from yours; my heart should
go hand in hand with duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prudent and cold were her words, and the
lover would have felt wounded, had he not seen
her swollen eyes, cheeks flushed with weeping,
and whole frame agitated with emotion.
They parted, and in a few weeks she had bidden
adieu to her kind teacher and friends, and was on
the broad ocean, each day lessening the distance
between her and her island home. As the hour of
meeting with her father approached, her heart sunk
within her, and she could scarcely restrain her
emotion; but the sight of his sad face beaming with
fatherly gratification, and the broken words of welcome
with which he greeted her, completely over-powered
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
her, and she threw herself upon his bosom
with a burst of self-reproaching tears. He soothed
her, and with loving words expressed his gratitude
to her for having thought of his happiness in preference
to her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you value my peace of mind, dearest father,”
she exclaimed, “you must never allude to the past—in
the future you will find me, I trust, all you can
wish. I have no other desire than that of making
you happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cora’s home was a luxurious though a solitary
one. Her father had purchased a fine plantation,
where, surrounded by slaves, she scarcely ever
met with any society. With the families of some
neighboring planters she occasionally mingled, but
from preference both her father and herself preferred
seclusion. The most rare and costly specimens of
art surrounded her. Her father had spared no expense
in preparing the house for her reception. He
had employed a trusty friend in Europe to purchase
every luxury, and she found her drawing-rooms,
music-room, conservatory, boudoir, and bed-room
fitted up in the most exquisite and elegant style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a person of perfect taste, dear papa,”
she said. “Every thing I see around me gives
evidence of the most refined and cultivated mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father looked his pleasure as she expressed
her admiration of the house and its appointments,
and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not, Cora, give me the credit entirely.
I was assisted in every thing by my friend Martinez.
He helped me plan my house. Insisted that
it should be placed on this delightful slope, that the
windows of your suite of rooms might command
the fine view you so much admire, and then, as he
was about leaving for Europe, I commissioned him
to procure there every thing that could possibly
add a charm to the residence of my only, long expected
daughter. Five years, dear Cora, have we
been planning and perfecting this home for you.
Martinez spent three years abroad in collecting all
these paintings, statuary, and other elegancies.
According to his directions are these beautiful books
constantly forwarded; those instruments were
chosen by him while in Paris; a fine musician himself,
he selected your musical library, and has given
orders to have the best of the new compositions
constantly sent to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! M. Martinez your partner?” inquired
Cora. “Dear old man, how well I remember him—but
I thought I heard of his death many years
ago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This M. Martinez is his nephew,” replied her
father; “he succeeded his uncle in business, and
has been my partner for some ten or fifteen years.
He is a very superior man—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he now?” asked Cora.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is in Italy,” replied her father. “He has
never been a very active business man. Inheriting
his uncle’s fortune, he concluded to leave the capital
in our concern, and his name in the firm, though
not by any means performing his uncle’s duties.
His pursuits are wholly different—he is a fine scholar,
and resides almost entirely in Europe. He returned
last summer to see the completion of my
house, and the arrangement of the furniture, but I
could not persuade him to remain longer than a
few months with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And his family, where are they?” inquired
Cora.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He lost his wife,” replied Mr. Neill, “many
years since. A few months after their marriage
she died. He was devotedly attached to her, and
I think he never has recovered entirely from the
shock; and on that account a residence in Cuba is
disagreeable to him—it recalls his suddenly wrecked
hopes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cora had not been many months with her father
when she discovered that the close attention he had
paid to his business, since the elder Martinez’ death,
had impaired his health. She had, on her first arrival
at home, contented herself with performing
what few duties fell to her, and the hours her father
spent with her, she exerted herself, though sometimes
with labor, to amuse him; but those hours of
the day that were left unoccupied, she was too
prone to give herself up to the luxury of sad reminiscences,
and as she looked around her luxurious
home she would weepingly sigh for that one being,
who, next to her father, held the first place in her
heart. Her health would have been undoubtedly
affected by this romantic indulgence, had she not
had her fears aroused for her father’s safety, and
terrified at the shadow of real sorrow she reproached
herself for her weakness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She entreated him to yield up some of his duties;
part of the business might be given up. “You are
not well,” she urged, “leave business entirely;
what you have already made will suffice for us—though,
owing to your kindness, I have indulged
myself in imaginary wants, I will most willingly
content myself with fewer luxuries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father opposed her entreaties. Martinez, the
only partner, was abroad—no agent could attend
to his affairs—business had never been so prosperous
as now—he was well enough. In a few
years he would wind up, and then they would go
to Europe for a year or two to restore his strength.
A few months afterward however found him
stretched on a bed of sickness, and so alarming
was it, that M. Martinez had to be summoned to
what the weeping Cora feared would be her father’s
death-bed. But careful, devoted attention on her
part, and skillful physicians, warded off the immediate
danger, and when M. Martinez arrived, Mr.
Neill was convalescent, though his health remained
in a very delicate state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then consented to yield to Cora’s entreaties,
and in a little while all his affairs were arranged
by M. Martinez, and he had retired from business.
There was no need for any sacrifice, even of a
single luxury. Mr. Neill found himself possessed
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
of ample means—placed in good investments it
yielded more than sufficient for their expenditures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cora was surprised at M. Martinez’ appearance.
She had pictured to herself a middle-aged Spaniard,
recalling the recollections she had of his uncle,
which were any thing but complimentary to the
nephew; for though the elder Martinez was a good
old man, he was a very homely one; being short,
thick-set, and his complexion was cloudy and dark.
The younger Martinez, on the contrary, was a tall,
handsome man, and although forty or forty-five
years of age, looked full ten years younger, and was
exceedingly polished and agreeable in his manners.
He was their constant guest, and she found the
hours passing much more agreeably since his
arrival than before. His conversation was interesting—he
had seen much of the world, and had
improved by intercourse with society. He possessed
many accomplishments and soon interested
himself in Cora’s pursuits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was charmed with his superior attainments,
and found herself at last relying on him, and looking
up to him as to a much-loved elder brother.
She never for an instant thought of loving him.
Though hopelessly separated from Harry Belton,
she cherished the memory of their attachment with
almost sacred earnestness. She frequently heard
from Madame Chalon, but the good Madame never
mentioned his name, and she was quite ignorant of
any thing relating to him. She had ceased repining
for their separation since her father’s dangerous illness,
but her thoughts dwelt upon him as a loved
one buried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three or four years passed quietly but happily
away. M. Martinez almost resided with them.
He talked with Mr. Neill, and read, sketched, rode
or practiced music with Cora. Her intercourse with
M. Martinez gave a new impulse to her mind, and
instead of giving herself up to the “luxury of grief,”
and indulging in idle reveries of the past, as she
had formerly, she studied and strengthened her intellectual
nature. Her father’s health still remained
delicate, which was the only drawback on her
placid happiness. It was necessary to observe great
precaution with him, for the slightest exposure or
excitement brought on symptoms of his first attack.
The constant watchful care which M. Martinez and
Cora observed over him, might have prolonged his
life many years, had not pecuniary misfortunes
overtaken him. The principal part of his fortune
had been invested in stocks that proved to be worthless,
and left him penniless. The news of their insolvency
reached Mr. Neill by letters, before M.
Martinez had heard of it, and the anguish he felt at
finding himself in his old age deprived of the fruits
of long laborious years, produced a fresh hemorrhage
from the lungs, more alarming than the first, and
nearly caused his immediate death. He rallied,
however, and appeared better; still the physicians
could give no hope for his recovery; he might
linger, they said, but only for a little while. After
the immediate danger was over, M. Martinez departed
for Havana, to make inquiries into Mr.
Neill’s affairs. A few days after his departure, Cora
received from him a letter, which filled her with
amazement. It contained an offer of marriage from
M. Martinez.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of your first attachment, Cora, I am aware,” he
wrote. “I knew of it at the time, and felt for you
deeply and honored you for your heroic self-sacrifice.
I have always considered myself as wedded to the
memory of my wife, but I have felt for you since I
have known you, a regard that approaches very
near to the love I felt for my lost Inez. I am alone
in life. I have no one to care for but you and your
father. Be my wife—one half, yes, I may say all
your father’s sorrow will be alleviated by this step
on your part. He knows not of this application,
nor shall he if you reply in the negative. If I am
repulsive to you, or if you look forward to a marriage
with Lieut. Belton, I will not urge you—but
if, as I hope, you are disengaged, and have long
since given up all expectation of marriage with
your first choice, and I am not personally disagreeable
to you, I entreat of you to give me a favorable
hearing. Be my wife, Cora—beloved Cora—I may
say, for however you decide, you are very dear to
me; and if constant, devoted attention on my part
can secure your happiness, or can even make life
placidly agreeable to you, I shall feel content. I do
not hesitate to say, Cora, though cherishing the
memory of my Inez with tenderness, if you reject
my suit my life will become as wearisome and devoid
of sunshine as it was before I knew you—lonely
and dreary will be my future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only waited, before your father’s troubles
brought me to this crisis, for the least evidence of
interest on your part toward me, to make the offer
which I do now. In a few days I shall return—from
your first glance, dearest Cora, I shall know
your decision. I pray you, let it be favorable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was aroused from the perplexing reverie this
letter had plunged her into, by an evident change
in her father. He was weaker, and apparently
sinking rapidly—and when M. Martinez returned,
he met Cora over her father’s death-bed. Mr. Neill
expressed his anguish in heart rending lamentations
at leaving his daughter, and besought M. Martinez
to watch over her as a brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martinez took the hand of the sobbing girl and
murmured—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beloved Cora, cheer your father’s last moments
by yielding to my wishes; let me tell him that as a
husband I will guard you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She permitted him to raise her head and rest it
on his shoulder, and the good father’s last moments
were soothed by witnessing the marriage of his
daughter with the man he most highly valued as a
friend. It was a sad bridal, but Cora felt that two
at least were happy; self-sacrifice she had brought
her mind years before to endure; and she prayed
that Heaven might make the present sacrifice work
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
out her own content. Mr. Neill died, and Cora
found herself a fatherless bride. Untiring was her
husband’s devotion, and most soothing and consoling
were his attentions. Soon after her father’s
death he persuaded her to leave their beautiful
home for a while, and they accordingly traveled
for some time in Europe. The change of scene
enlivened her, and she was becoming satisfied with
the step she had taken, when, at Naples, one season
she met with Harry, now Captain Belton. He was
still unmarried, for, like her, he had retained a feeling
of romance for his first love. They met with
a few flutterings on both sides, which, however,
soon disappeared. Each found the other different
from the ideal image cherished in their memories.
Harry was a noble-hearted, frank fellow, but sadly
wanting in the intellectual elevation that characterized
M. Martinez, and Cora, though still beautiful,
he thought her not half so conversible or interesting
as his little black-eyed cousin, Sophie Wilson, with
whom he had flirted at Washington on her <span class='it'>entrée</span>
into society, the previous winter, and with whom
he corresponded most platonically and brother-like.
Had Cora and Harry married early in life, she would
have adapted herself partly to his tastes, and he to
hers—they would have met half way. She would
have elevated him intellectually, and they would
probably have been happy; but their pursuits had
been different. His had been a careless, indolent
life, independent of the mere performance of the
duties of his profession—hers an intellectual one.
She had become entirely elevated above him; her
mental powers had developed while his laid dormant,
and she felt as she turned and looked upon
the intellectual beauty of M. Martinez, and contrasted
it with the tolerably good-looking, though
broad and rather inexpressive face of her early
love, that the prayer she had made so fervently
over her father’s death-bed, had been granted. Her
marriage had brought to her true happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry Belton returned home with his romantic
dreams dispelled, and the next season the American
papers gave notice of the marriage of “Captain
Belton, U. S. N., to Sophie, only daughter of Gen.
Wilson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cora pointed out the notice to her husband with
a smile on her now full red lip, and with a deeper
flush on her cheek than it usually wore, she said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How fortunate it was, dearest, that Harry and
I met at Naples last summer—otherwise we might
both have gone through life, fancying ourselves miserably
unhappy about the romance of a first love.”</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Yet she saw, with secret terror,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Count Alberto, in the mirror,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Stealing through the curtained door,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a fearful, shadowy spirit, whom a curse is hanging o’er.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;What! so soon from far Palermo?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Has he left the feast of pride—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Has he left the knightly tourney</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For the happy homeward journey</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the greeting of his bride?</p>
<p class='line0'>Coldly, darkly, in her bosom, the upspringing rapture died!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With a glance of tender meaning</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;On the maid he softly smiled,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the answering smile, and token</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In her glowing blushes spoken,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Well betrayed the shepherd’s child!</p>
<p class='line0'>To her gaze, within the mirror, stood that picture dim and wild!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Moved again the silken curtain,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;As he passed without a sound;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Then the sunset’s fading ember</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Died within the lonely chamber,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the darkness gathered round,</p>
<p class='line0'>While in passion’s fierce delirium was the lady’s bosom bound.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Threat’ning shadows seemed to gather</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the twilight of the room,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the thoughts, vibrating changeful</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Through her spirit, grew revengeful</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With their whisperings of doom:</p>
<p class='line0'>Starting suddenly, she vanished far amid the deep’ning gloom.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the stillness of the forest</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Falls a timid, trembling gleam,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With a ruby radiance sparkling</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;On the rill that ripples darkling</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Through the thicket, like a dream:</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Dark and grim, like sentries, stand;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And within the ghostly grotto</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Sits the gloomy Baron Otto,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Chieftain of the dreaded band,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With the orange-buds’ perfume,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;While the lady waited there</p>
<p class='line0'>With a deep, uncertain anguish, which her spirit scarce could bear.</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Mingled thoughts of love and vengeance</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;When the silver lamp of Hesper</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Twinkled through the silent vesper,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And their bosoms beat as one,</p>
<p class='line0'>Thrilling o’er with too much fervor, like a blossom in the sun.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Olden words in music echoed</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But its buds of love were rifled,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the spirit voice was stifled,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Which would tell of tender hours;</p>
<p class='line0'>Nevermore may second sunshine bid re-bloom its perished flowers!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Still that dark foreboding lingered</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Over all her pride and hate,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Like a stifling mist, that ever</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Hangs above a burning river</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With its dull and stagnant weight:</p>
<p class='line0'>Slowly o’er the spectral Future crept the shadows of her fate!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Now the eastern stars had mounted,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the midnight watch was o’er,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;When the long suspense was broken</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;By a hasty watchword spoken,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And a dark form passed the door.</p>
<p class='line0'>Blood was on his golden scabbard, and the sable robe he wore.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“By this blade, most noble lady,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Then, upstarting from her languor,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Cried she, in returning anger:</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“Where reposed the trait’rous knight?</p>
<p class='line0'>Didst thou tear him from <span class='it'>her</span> clasping—strike him down before her sight?”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“Nay, not so: in bright Palermo,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the gardens of the palace,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Did the green earth, from its chalice,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Drink his bosom’s brightest wine,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the latest name that faltered on his dying lips, was <span class='it'>thine</span>!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With a scream, as agonizing</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In its horror and despair,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;As if life’s last hold were started,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Ere the soul in torture parted,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Stood she, pale and shuddering, there,</p>
<p class='line0'>With her face of marble lifted in the cavern’s noisome air.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“God of Heaven! that fearful image,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;On the mirror’s surface thrown!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Not Alberto, but a demon,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Looked on her as on a leman,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the guilt is mine alone!</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And it holds a cloudy mirror,</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With a shriek, prolonged and painful,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Through the wood she fled afar,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Where the air was awed and fearful,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And between the boughs the tearful</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Shining of a dewy star</p>
<p class='line0'>Pierced alone the solid darkness which enclosed her as a bar.</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Night by night, in gloom and terror,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;From the crag and from the glen</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Came those cries, the quiet breaking,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Till the shepherd-dogs, awaking,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Bayed in loud and mournful pain,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the vintager, benighted, trembled on the distant plain.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Years went by, and stranger footsteps</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Rang in castle, bower and hall;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Yet the shrieks, at midnight ringing,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Spoke the curse upon it clinging,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And they left it to its fall,</p>
<p class='line0'>And an utter desolation slowly settled over all.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Still, when o’er the brow of Etna</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;How she felt the fiend’s control,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY T. S. ARTHUR.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Early</span> in life Mr. Jenkins had been what is called
unfortunate in business. Either from the want of
right management, or from causes that he could not
well control, he became involved, and was broken
all to pieces. It was not enough that he gave up
every dollar he possessed in the world. In the
hope that friends would interfere to prevent his
being sent to jail, some of his creditors pressed
eagerly for the balance of their claims, and the unhappy
debtor had no alternative but to avail himself
of the statute made and provided for the benefit
of individuals in his extremity. It was a sore trial
for him; but any thing rather than to be thrown
into prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this tempest of trouble and excitement,
there fell upon the spirits of Mr. Jenkins a great
calm. He withdrew himself from public observation
for a time, but his active mind would not let
him remain long in obscurity. In a few months he
was again in business, though in a small way. His
efforts were more cautiously directed than before,
and proved successful. He made something above
his expenses during the first year, and after that
accumulated money rapidly. In five or six years
Mr. Jenkins was worth some nine or ten thousand
dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with this prosperity came no disposition on
the part of Mr. Jenkins to pay off his old obligations.
“They used the law against me,” he would
say, when the subject pressed itself upon his mind,
as it would sometimes do, “and now let them get
what the law will give them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a curious provision in the law by
which Jenkins had been freed from all the claims of
his creditors against him; and this provision is
usually incorporated in all similar laws, though for
what reason it is hard to tell. It is only necessary
to promise to pay a claim thus annulled, to bring it
in full force against the debtor. If a man owes another
a hundred dollars, and by economy and self-denial
succeeds in saving twenty dollars and paying
it to him, he becomes at once liable for the remaining
eighty dollars, unless the manner of doing
it be very guarded, and is in danger of a prosecution,
although unable to pay another cent. A prudent
man, who has once been forced into the unhappy
alternative of taking the benefit of the insolvent
law, is always careful, lest, in an unguarded
moment, he acknowledge his liability to some old
creditor, before he is fully able to meet it. Anxious
as he is to assure this one and that one of his desire
and intention to pay them if ever in his power,
and to say to them that he is struggling early and
late for their sakes as well as his own, his lips must
remain sealed. A word of his intentions and all
his fond hopes of getting fairly on his feet again are
in danger of shipwreck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Understanding the binding force of a promise of
this kind, made in writing, or in the presence of
witnesses, certain of the more selfish or less manly
and honorable class of creditors, are ever seeking
to extort by fair or foul means, from an unfortunate
debtor who has honestly given up every thing, an
acknowledgment of his indebtedness to them, in
order that they may reap the benefit of his first efforts
to get upon his feet again. Many and many an
honest but indiscreet debtor, has been thrown upon
his back once more, from this cause, and all his
hopes in life blasted forever. The means of approach
to a debtor in this situation are many and
various. “Do you think you will ever be able to
do any thing on that old account?” blandly asked,
in the presence of a third party, is answered by, “I
hope so. But, at present, it takes every dollar I can
earn for the support of my family.” This is sufficient—the
whole claim is in full force. In the
course of a month or two, perhaps in a less period,
a sheriff’s writ is served, and the poor fellow’s furniture,
or small stock in trade, is seized, and he
broken all up again. To have replied—“You have
no claim against me,” to the insidious question,
seemed in the mind of the poor, but honest man,
so much like a public confession that he was a
rogue, that he could not do it. And yet this was
his only right course, and he should have taken it
firmly. Letters are often written, calling attention
to the old matter, in which are well timed allusions
to the debtor’s known integrity of character, and
willingness to pay every dollar he owes in the
world, if ever able. Such letters should never be
answered, for the answer will be almost sure to
contain something, that, in a court of justice, will
be construed into an acknowledgment of the entire
claim. In paying off old accounts that the law has
canceled, which we think every man should do if
in his power, the acknowledgment of indebtedness
never need go further than the amount paid at any
time. Beyond this, no creditor who does not wish
to oppress, will ask a man to go. If any seek a
further revival of the old claim, let the debtor beware
of them; and also, let him be on his guard
against him who, in any way, alludes either in writing
or personally, to the previous indebtedness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we have digressed far enough. Mr. Jenkins,
we are sorry to say, was not of that class of debtors
who never consider an obligation morally canceled.
The law once on his side, he fully made up his
mind to keep it forever between him and all former
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
transactions. Sundry were the attempts made to
get old claims against him revived, after it was
clearly understood that he was getting to be worth
money, but Jenkins was a rogue at least, and rogues
are always more wary than honest men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the creditors of Jenkins was a man named
Gooding, who had loaned him five hundred dollars,
and lost three hundred of it—two-fifths being all
that was realized from the debtor’s effects. Gooding
pitied sincerely the misfortunes of Jenkins, and
pocketed his loss without saying a hard word, or
laying the weight of a finger upon his already too
heavily burdened shoulders. But it so happened
that as Jenkins commenced going up in the world,
Gooding began to go down. At the time when the
former was clearly worth ten thousand dollars, he
was hardly able to get money enough to pay his
quarterly rent bills. Several times he thought of
calling the attention of his old debtor to the balance
still against him, which, as it was for borrowed
money, ought certainly to be paid. But it was an
unpleasant thing to remind a friend of an old obligation,
and Gooding, for a time, chose to bear his
troubles, as the least disagreeable of the two alternatives.
At last, however, difficulties pressed so hard
upon him, that he forced himself to the task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both he and Jenkins lived about three quarters
of a mile distant from their places of business, in a
little village beyond the suburbs of the city. Gooding
was lame, and used to ride to and from his
store in a small wagon, which was used for sending
home goods during the day. Jenkins usually walked
into town in the morning, and home in the evening.
It not unfrequently happened that Gooding overtook
the latter, while riding home after business hours,
when he always invited him to take a seat by his
side, which invitation was never declined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were riding home in this way one evening,
when Gooding, after clearing his throat two or three
times, said, with a slight faltering in his voice,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry, neighbor Jenkins, to make any allusion
to old matters, but as you are getting along
very comfortably, and I am rather hard pressed,
don’t you think you could do something for me on
account of the three hundred dollars due for borrowed
money? If it had been a regular business debt,
I would never have said a word about it, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neighbor Gooding,” said Jenkins, interrupting
him, “don’t give yourself a moment’s uneasiness
about that matter. It shall be paid, every dollar of
it; but I am not able, just yet, to make it up for
you. But you shall have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was said in the blandest way imaginable,
yet in a tone of earnestness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How soon do you think you can do something
for me?” asked Gooding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. If not disappointed, however, I
think I can spare you a little in a couple of months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My rent is due on the first of October. If you
can let me have, say fifty dollars, then, it will be a
great accommodation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will see. If in my power, you shall certainly
have at least that amount.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two months rolled round, and Gooding’s quarter
day came. Nothing more had been said by Jenkins
on the subject of the fifty dollars, and Gooding felt
very reluctant about reminding him of his promise;
but he was short in making up his rent, just the
promised sum. He waited until late in the day,
but Jenkins neither sent nor called. As the matter
was pressing, he determined to drop in upon his
neighbor, and remind him of what he had said. He
accordingly went round to the store of Jenkins, and
found him alone with his clerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you to-day?” said Jenkins, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. How are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So—so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Business rather dull,” remarked Jenkins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very,” replied Gooding, with a serious face, and
more serious tone of voice. “Nothing at all doing.
I never saw business so flat in my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flat enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahem! Mr. Jenkins,” began Gooding, after a
few moments, “do you think you can do any thing
for me to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there is any thing I can do for you, it shall be
done with pleasure,” said Jenkins, in a cheerful
way. “In what can I oblige you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember, you said that in all probability
you would be able to spare me as much as fifty
dollars to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> said so?” Jenkins asked this question with
an appearance of real surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Don’t you remember that we were riding
home one evening, about two months ago, and I
called your attention to the old account standing
between us, and you promised to pay it soon, and
said you thought you could spare me fifty dollars
about the time my quarter’s rent became due?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word, friend Gooding, I have no recollection
of the circumstance whatever,” replied Jenkins,
with a smile. “It must have been some one
else with whom you were riding. I never said I
owed you any thing, or promised to pay you fifty
dollars about this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes! but I am sure you did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I am just as sure that I did not,” returned
Jenkins, still perfectly undisturbed, while Gooding,
as might be supposed, felt his indignation just ready
to boil over. But the latter controlled himself as
best he could; and as soon as he could get away
from the store of Jenkins, without doing so in a
manner that would tend to close all intercourse
between them, he left and returned to his own place
of business, chagrined and angry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the same evening, as Gooding was riding
home, he saw Jenkins ahead of him on the road.
He soon overtook him. Jenkins turned his usual
smiling face upon his old creditor, and said “Good
evening,” in his usual friendly way. The invitation
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
to get up and ride, that always was given on like
occasions, was extended again, and in a few moments
the two men were riding along side by side,
as friendly, to all appearance, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jenkins, how could you serve me such a scaly
trick as you did?” Gooding said, soon after his
neighbor had taken a seat by his side. “You know
very well that you promised to pay my claim; and
also promised to give me fifty dollars of it to-day, if
possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know I did. But it was out of my power to
let you have any thing to-day,” replied Jenkins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what was the use of your denying it, and
making me out a liar or a fool in the presence of
your clerk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a very good reason for doing so. My
clerk would have been a witness to my acknowledgment
of your whole claim against me, and thus
make me liable before I was ready to pay it. As
my head is fairly clear of the halter, you cannot
blame me for wishing to keep it so. A burnt child,
you know, dreads the fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you know me well enough to know that I
never would have pressed the claim against you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend Gooding, I have seen enough of the
world to satisfy me that we don’t know any one.
I am very ready to say to you, that your claim shall
be satisfied to the full extent, whenever it is in my
power to do so; but a <span class='it'>legal</span> acknowledgment of the
claim I am not willing to make. You mustn’t think
hard of me for what I did to-day. I could not, in
justice to myself, have done any thing else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gooding professed to be fully satisfied with this
explanation, although he was not. He was very
well assured that Jenkins was perfectly able to pay
him the three hundred dollars if he chose to do so,
and that his refusal to let him have the fifty dollars,
conditionally promised, was a dishonest act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than a year passed, during which time
Gooding made many fruitless attempts to get something
out of Jenkins, who was always on the best
terms with him, but put him off with fair promises,
that were never kept. These promises were never
made in the presence of a third person, and might,
therefore, have just as well been made to the wind,
so far as their binding force was concerned. Things
grew worse and worse with Gooding, and he became
poorer every day, while the condition of Jenkins
as steadily improved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One rainy afternoon, Gooding drove up to the
store of his old friend, about half an hour earlier
than he usually left for home. Jenkins was standing
in the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As it is raining, I thought I would call round for
you,” he said, as he drew up his horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much obliged to you, indeed,” returned
Jenkins, quite well pleased. “Stop a moment until
I lock up my desk, and then I will be with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a minute or two Jenkins came out, and stepped
lightly into the wagon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is kind in you, really, to call for me,” he said,
as the wagon moved briskly away. “I was just
thinking that I should have to get a carriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is no trouble to me at all,” returned Gooding,
“and if it were, the pleasure of doing a friend a
kindness would fully repay it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You smell strong of whisky here,” said Jenkins,
after they had ridden a little way, turning his eyes
toward the back part of the wagon as he spoke.
“What have you here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An empty whisky hogshead. This rain put me
in mind of doing what my wife has been teasing me
to do for the last six months—get her a rain barrel.
I tried to get an old oil cask, but couldn’t find one.
They make the best rain barrels. Just burn them
out with a flash of good dry shavings, and they are
clear from all oily impurities, and tight as a drum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! I never thought that. I must look out
for one, for our old rain hogshead is about tumbling
to pieces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From rain barrels the conversation turned upon
business, and at length Gooding brought up the old
story, and urged the settlement of his claim as a
matter of charity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know how much I need it,” he said.
“Necessity alone compels me to press the claim
upon your attention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is hard, I know, and I am very sorry for you,”
Jenkins replied. “Next week I will certainly pay
you fifty dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be very thankful. How soon after do
you think you will be able to let me have the balance
of the three hundred due me? Say as early as
possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Within three months, at least, I hope,” replied
Jenkins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry! Do you hear that?” said Gooding,
turning his head toward the back part of the wagon,
and speaking in a quick elated manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, aye!” came ringing from the bung-hole of
the whisky hogshead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who the dickens is that?” exclaimed Jenkins,
turning quickly round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one,” replied Gooding, with a quiet smile,
“but my clerk, Harry Williams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” replied the individual named, pushing
himself up through the loose head of the upright
hogshead, and looking into the face of the discomfited
Jenkins, with a broad smile of satisfaction upon
his always humorous phiz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoa, Charley,” said Gooding, at this moment
reigning up his horse before the house of Jenkins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The latter stepped out, with his eyes upon the
ground, and stood with his hand upon the wagon
in thought for some moments; then looking up, he
said, while the humor of the whole thing pressed
itself so fully upon him, that he could not help
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here, Gooding, if both you and Harry will
promise me never to say a word about this confounded
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
trick, I will give you a check for three hundred
dollars on the spot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I must have four hundred and twenty-six
dollars, the principal and interest. Nothing less,”
returned Gooding firmly. “You have acknowledged
the debt in the presence of Mr. Williams, and if it
is not paid by to-morrow twelve o’clock, I shall
commence suit against you. If I receive the money
before that time we will keep this little matter quiet;
if suit is brought, all will come out on the trial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you please,” said Jenkins angrily, turning
away and entering his house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before twelve o’clock on the next day, however,
Jenkins’ clerk called in at the store of Gooding, and
paid him four hundred and twenty-six dollars, for
which he took his receipt in full for all demands to
date. The two men were never afterward on
terms of sufficient intimacy to ride in the same
wagon together. Whether Gooding and his clerk
kept the matter a secret, as they promised, we
don’t know. It is very certain, that it was known
all over town in less than a week, and soon after
was told in the newspapers as a most capital
joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Spike, he had no intention of going to the
southward of the Florida Reef again until his business
called him there. The lost bag of doubloons was
still gleaming before his imagination, and no sooner
did the Poughkeepsie bear up, than he shortened
sail, standing back and forth in his narrow and
crooked channel, rather losing ground than gaining,
though he took great pains not to let his artifice be
seen. When the Poughkeepsie was so far to the
northward as to render it safe, he took in every
thing but one or two of his lowest sails, and followed
easily in the same direction. As the sloop-of-war
carried her light and loftier sails, she remained
visible to the people of the Swash long after the
Swash had ceased to be visible to her. Profiting
by this circumstance, Spike entered the main
channel again some time before it was dark, and
selected a safe anchorage there that was well known
to him; a spot where sufficient sand had collected
on the coral to make good holding ground, and
where a vessel would be nearly embayed, though
always to windward of her channel going out, by
the formation of the reef. Here he anchored, in
order to wait until morning ere he ventured further
north. During the whole of that dreadful day, Rose
had remained in her cabin, disconsolate, nearly
unable, as she was absolutely unwilling to converse.
Now it was that she felt the total insufficiency of a
mind feeble as that of her aunt’s to administer consolation
to misery like her own. Nevertheless, the
affectionate solicitude of Mrs. Budd, as well as that of
the faithful creature, Biddy, brought some relief and
reason and resignation began slowly to resume their
influence. Yet was the horrible picture of Harry,
dying by inches, deserted in the midst of the waters
on his solitary rock, ever present to her thoughts,
until, once or twice, her feelings verged on madness.
Prayer brought its customary relief, however; and
we do not think that we much exaggerate the fact,
when we say that Rose passed fully one-half of that
terrible afternoon on her knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Jack Tier, he was received on board the
brig much as if nothing had happened. Spike passed
and repassed him fifty times, without even an angry
look, or a word of abuse; and the deputy-steward
dropped quietly into the duties of his office, without
meeting with either reproach or hindrance. The
only allusion, indeed, that was made to his recent
adventures, took place in a conversation that was
held on the subject in the galley, the interlocutors
being Jack himself, Josh, the steward, and Simon,
the cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where you been scullin’ to, ’bout on dat reef,
Jack, wid dem ’ere women, I won’er now?” demanded
Josh, after tasting the cabin soup, in order
to ascertain how near it was to being done. “I
t’ink it no great fun to dodge ’bout among dem
rock in a boat, for anudder hurricane might come
when a body least expeck him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Jack, cavalierly, “two hurricanes no
more come in one month, than two shot in the
same hole. We’ve been turtlin’, that’s all. I wish
we had in your coppers, cook, some of the critturs
that we fell in with in our cruise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wish ’e had, master steward, wid all my heart,”
answered the fat, glistening potentate of the galley.
“But, hark’ee, Jack; what become of our young
mate, can ’e tell? Some say he get kill at ’e
Dry Tortugas, and some say he war’ scullin’
round in dat boat you hab, wid ’e young woman,
eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, boys,” answered Jack, mournfully, “sure
enough, what <span class='it'>has</span> become of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
“You know, why can’t you tell? What good to
hab secret among friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Are</span> ye his friends, lads? Do you really feel as
if you could give a poor soul in its agony a helpin’
hand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” said Josh, in a reproachful way.
“Misser Mulford ’e bess mate dis brig ever get; and
I don’t see why Capt. Spike want to be rid of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he’s a willian!” returned Jack between
his grated teeth. “D’ye know what that means in
English, master Josh; and can you and cook here,
both of whom have sailed with the man years in
and years out, say whether my words be true
or not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat as a body understand ’em. Accordin’ to
some rule, Stephen Spike not a werry honest man;
but, accordin’ to ’nudder some, he as good as any
body else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dat just de upshot of de matter,” put in
Simon, approvingly. “De whole case lie in dat
meanin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’ye call it right to leave a human being to
starve, or to suffer for water, on a naked rock, in
the midst of the ocean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who do dat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The willian who is captain of this brig; and all
because he thinks young eyes and bloomin’ cheeks
prefar young eyes and bloomin’ cheeks to his own
grizzly beard and old look-outs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat bad; dat werry bad,” said Josh, shaking his
head, a way of denoting dissatisfaction, in which
Simon joined him; for no crime appeared sufficiently
grave in the eyes of these two sleek and well-fed
officials to justify such a punishment. “Dat mons’ous
bad, and cap’in ought to know better dan do
<span class='it'>dat</span>. I nebber starves a mouse, if I catches him in de
bread-locker. Now, dat a sort of reason’ble punishment,
too; but I nebber does it. If mouse eat my
bread, it do seem right to tell mouse dat he hab
enough, and dat he must not eat any more for a
week, or a mont’, but it too cruel for me, and I nebber
does it; no, I t’rows the little debbil overboard,
and lets him drown like a gentle’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Y-e-s,” drawled out Simon, in a philanthropical
tone of voice, “dat ’e best way. What good it do to
torment a fellow critter? If Misser Mulford run,
why put him down run, and let him go, I say, on’y
mulk his wages: but what good it do anybody to
starve him. Now dis is my opinion, gentle’em, and
dat is, dat starwation be wuss dan choleric. Choleric
kill, I knows, and so does starwation kill; but of de
two, gib me de choleric fuss; if I gets well of dat,
den try starwation if you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad to hear you talk in this manner, my
hearties,” put in Jack; “and I hope I shall find you
accommodatin’ in a plan I’ve got to help the maty
out of this difficulty. As a friend of Stephen Spike’s
I would do it; for it must be a terrible thing to die
with such a murder on one’s soul. Here’s the boat
that we pick’d up at the light-house, yonder, in tow
of the brig at this minute; and there’s every thing
in her comfortable for a good long run, as I know
from having sailed in her; and what I mean is this:
as we left Mr. Mulford, I took the bearings and distance
of the rock he was on, d’ye understand, and
think I could find my way back to it. You see the
brig is travelin’ slowly north ag’in, and afore long
we shall be in the neighborhood of that very rock.
We, cook and stewards, will be called on to keep
an anchor-watch, if the brig fetches up, as I heard
the captain tell the Spanish gentleman he thought
she would; and then we can take the boat that’s in
the water and go and have a hunt for the maty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two blacks looked at Tier earnestly; then
they turned their heads to look at each other. The
idea struck each as bold and novel, but each saw
serious difficulties in it. At length Josh, as became
his superior station, took on himself the office of expressing
the objections that occurred to his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat nebber do!” exclaimed the steward. “We
be’s quite willin’ to sarve ’e mate, who’s a good
gentle’em, and as nice a young man as ever sung
out, ‘hard a-lee,’ but we must t’ink little bit of number
one; or, for dat matter, of number two, as
Simon would be implercated as well as myself. If
Cap’in Spike once knew we’ve lent a hand in sich
a job, he’d never overlook it. I knows him, <span class='it'>well</span>;
and that is sayin’ as much as need be said of any
man’s character. You nebber catch <span class='it'>me</span> running
myself into his jaws; would rather fight a shark
widout any knife. No, no—I knows him <span class='it'>well</span>. Den
comes anudder werry unanswerable objecsh’un,
and dat is, dat ’e brig owe bot’ Simon and I money.
Fifty dollars, each on us, if she owe one cent. Now,
do you t’ink in cander, Jack, dat two color’ gentle’em,
like us, can t’row away our fortins like two sons of
a York merchant dat has inherited a hundred t’ousand
dollar tudder day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no occasion for runnin’ at all, or for
losing your wages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How you get ’e mate off, den? Can he walk
away on de water? If so, let him go widout us.
A werry good gentle’em is Misser Mulford, but not
good enough to mulk Simon and me out of fifty
dollar each.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not hear my project, Josh, and so will
never know what I would be at.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, come, tell him jest as you surposes him.
Now listen, Simon, so dat not a word be loss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My plan is to take the boat, if we anchor, as
anchor I know we shall, and go and find the rock
and bring Mr. Mulford off; then we can come back
to the brig, and get on board ourselves, and let the
mate sail away in the boat by himself. On this plan
nobody will run, and no wages be mulcted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But dat take time, and an anchor-watch last but
two hour, surposin’ even dat ’ey puts all t’ree of us
in de same watch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spike usually does that, you know. ‘Let the
cook and the stewards keep the midnight watch,’
he commonly says, ‘and that will give the foremost
hands a better snooze.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
“Yes, he do say <span class='it'>dat</span>, Josh,” put in Simon, “most
ebbery time we comes-to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know he does, and surposes he will say it to-night,
if he comes-to to-night. But a two hour watch
may not be long enough to do all you wants; and
den, jest t’ink for a moment, should ’e cap’in come
on deck and hail ’e forecastle, and find us all gone,
I wouldn’t be in your skin, Jack, for dis brig, in sich
a kerlamity. I knows Cap’in Spike well; t’ree time
I endebber to run myself, and each time he bring me
up wid a round turn; so, now-a-days, I nebber t’inks
of sich a projeck any longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do not intend to leave the forecastle without
some one on it to answer a hail. No, all I want
is a companion; for I do not like to go out on the
reef at midnight, all alone. If one of you will go
with me, the other can stay and answer the captain’s
hail, should he really come on deck in our
watch—a thing very little likely to happen. When
once his head is on his pillow, a’ter a hard day’s
work, it’s not very apt to be lifted ag’in without a
call, or a squall. If you do know Stephen Spike <span class='it'>well</span>,
Josh, I know him better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Jack, dis here is a new idee, d’ye see, and
a body must take time to consider on it. If Simon
and I do ship for dis v’y’ge, ’twill be for lub of Mr.
Mulford, and not for <span class='it'>his</span> money or <span class='it'>your’n</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was all the encouragement of his project
Jack Tier could obtain, on that occasion, from either
his brother steward, or from the cook. These blacks
were well enough disposed to rescue an innocent
and unoffending man from the atrocious death to
which Spike had condemned his mate, but neither
lost sight of his own security and interest. They
promised Tier not to betray him, however; and he
had the fullest confidence in their pledges. They
who live together in common, usually understand
the feeling that prevails, on any given point, in their
own set; and Jack felt pretty certain that Harry
was a greater favorite in and about the camboose
than the captain. On that feeling he relied, and he
was fain to wait the course of events, ere he came
to any absolute conclusion as to his own course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interview in the galley took place about half
an hour before the brig anchored for the night.
Tier, who often assisted on such occasions, went
aloft to help secure the royal, one of the gaskets of
which had got <a id='loose'></a>loose, and from the yard he had an
excellent opportunity to take a look at the reef, the
situation of the vessel, and the probable bearings of
the rock on which poor Mulford had been devoted
to a miserable death. This opportunity was much
increased by Spike’s hailing him, while on the yard,
and ordering him to take a good look at the sloop-of-war,
and at the same time to ascertain if any boats
were “prowlin’ about, in order to make a set upon
us in the night.” On receiving this welcome order,
Jack answered with a cheerful “Ay, ay, sir,” and
standing up on the yard, he placed an arm around
the mast, and remained for a long time making his
observations. The command to look-out for boats
would have been a sufficient excuse had he continued
on the yard as long as it was light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack had no difficulty in finding the Poughkeepsie,
which was already through the passage, and no
longer visible from the deck. She appeared to be
standing to the northward and westward, under easy
canvas, like a craft that was in no hurry. This fact
was communicated to Spike in the usual way. The
latter seemed pleased, and he answered in a hearty
manner, just as if no difficulty had ever occurred
between him and the steward’s assistant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, Jack! bravo, Jack!—now take a good
look for boats; you’ll have light enough for that this
half hour,” cried the captain. “If any are out,
you’ll find them pulling down the channel, or maybe
they’ll try to shorten the cut, by attempting to pull
athwart the reef. Take a good and steady look for
them, my man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir; I’ll do all I can with naked eyes,”
answered Jack, “but I could do better, sir, if they
would only send me up a glass by these here signal-halyards.
With a glass, a fellow might speak with
some sartainty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike seemed struck with the truth of this suggestion;
and he soon sent a glass aloft by the signal-halyards.
Thus provided, Jack descended as low
as the cross-trees, where he took his seat, and began
a survey at his leisure. While thus employed, the
brig was secured for the night, her decks were
cleared, and the people were ordered to get their
suppers, previously to setting an anchor-watch, and
turning-in for the night. No one heeded the movements
of Tier, for Spike had gone into his own state-room,
with the exception of Josh and Simon. Those
two worthies were still in the galley, conversing
on the subject of Jack’s recent communications, and
ever and anon one of them would stick his head out
of the door and look aloft, withdrawing it, and shaking
it significantly, as soon as his observations were
ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Tier, he was seated quite at his ease; and
having slung his glass to one of the shrouds, in a
way to admit of its being turned as on a pivot, he
had every opportunity for observing accurately, and
at his leisure. The first thing Jack did, was to examine
the channel very closely, in order to make
sure that no boats were in it, after which he turned
the glass with great eagerness toward the reef, in
the almost hopeless office of ascertaining something
concerning Mulford. In point of fact, the brig had
anchored quite three leagues from the solitary rock
of the deserted mate, and, favored as he was by his
elevation, Jack could hardly expect to discern so
small and low an object as that rock at so great a
distance. Nevertheless, the glass was much better
than common. It had been a present to Spike from
one who was careful in his selections of such objects,
and who had accidentally been under a serious
obligation to the captain. Knowing the importance
of a good look, as regards the boats, Spike had
brought this particular instrument, of which, in common,
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
he was very chary, from his own state-room,
and sent it aloft, in order that Jack might have every
available opportunity of ascertaining his facts. It
was this glass, then, which was the means of the
important discoveries the little fellow, who was thus
perched on the fore-topmast cross-trees of the Swash,
did actually succeed in making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack actually started, when he first ascertained
how distinctly and near the glass he was using
brought distant objects. The gulls that sailed across
its disk, though a league off, appeared as if near
enough to be touched by the hand, and even their
feathers gave out not only their hues, but their forms.
Thus, too, was it with the surface of the ocean, of
which the little waves that agitated the water of
the reef, might be seen tossing up and down, at
more than twice the range of the Poughkeepsie’s
heaviest gun. Naked rocks, low and subdued as
they were in color, too, were to be noted, scattered
up and down in the panorama. At length Tier
fancied his glass covered a field that he recognized.
It was distant, but might be seen from his present
elevation. A second look satisfied him he was right;
and he next clearly traced the last channel in which
they had endeavored to escape from Spike, or that
in which the boat had been taken. Following it
along, by slowly moving the glass, he actually hit
the rock on which Mulford had been deserted. It
was peculiar in shape, size, and elevation above
the water, and connected with the circumstance
of the channel, which was easily enough seen by
the color of the water, and more easily from his
height than if he had been in it, he could not be mistaken.
The little fellow’s heart beat quick as he
made the glass move slowly over its surface,
anxiously searching for the form of the mate. It
was not to be seen. A second, and a more careful
sweep of the glass, made it certain that the rock was
deserted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although a little reflection might have satisfied
any one, Mulford was not to be sought in that particular
spot, so long after he had been left there.
Jack Tier felt grievously disappointed when he was
first made certain of the accuracy of his observations.
A minute later he began to reason on the
matter, and he felt more encouraged. The rock on
which the mate had been abandoned was smooth,
and could not hold any fresh water that might have
been left by the late showers. Jack also remembered
that it had neither sea-weed nor shell-fish. In
short, the utmost malice of Spike could not have
selected, for the immolation of his victim, a more
suitable place. Now Tier had heard Harry’s explanation
to Rose, touching the manner in which he
had waded and swam about the reef that very morning,
and it at once occurred to him that the young
man had too much energy and spirit to remain
helpless and inactive to perish on a naked rock,
when there might be a possibility of at least prolonging
existence, if not of saving it. This induced
the steward to turn the glass slowly over the water,
and along all the ranges of visible rock that he could
find in that vicinity. For a long time the search
was useless, the distance rendering such an examination
not only difficult but painful. At length Jack,
about to give up the matter in despair, took one
sweep with the glass nearer to the brig, as much to
obtain a general idea of the boat-channels of the
reef, as in any hope of finding Mulford, when an
object moving in the water came within the field of
the glass. He saw it but for an instant, as the glass
swept slowly past, but it struck him it was something
that had life, and was in motion. Carefully
going over the same ground again, after a long
search, he again found what he so anxiously sought.
A good look satisfied him that he was right. It was
certainly a man wading along the shallow water of
the reef, immersed to his waist—and it must be
Mulford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So excited was Jack Tier by this discovery that
he trembled like a leaf. A minute or two elapsed
before he could again use the glass; and when he
did, a long and anxious search was necessary before
so small an object could be once more found.
Find it he did, however, and then he got its range
by the vessel, in a way to make sure of it. Yes, it
was a man, and it was Mulford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Circumstances conspired to aid Jack in the investigation
that succeeded. The sun was near setting,
but a stream of golden light gleamed over the waters,
particularly illuminating the portion which came
within the field of the glass. Then Harry, in his
efforts to escape from the rock, and to get nearer to
the edge of the main channel, where his chances of
being seen and rescued would be ten-fold what they
were on his rock, had moved south, by following
the naked reef and the shallow places, and was actually
more than a league nearer to the brig than
he would have been had he remained stationary.
There had been hours in which to make this change,
and the young man had probably improved them to
the utmost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack watched the form that was wading slowly
along with an interest he had never before felt in
the movements of any human being. Whether
Mulford saw the brig or not, it was difficult to say.
She was quite two leagues from him, and, now that
her sails were furled, she offered but little for the
eye to rest on at that distance. At first, Jack thought
the young man was actually endeavoring to get
nearer to her, though it must have been a forlorn
hope that should again place him in the hands of
Spike. It was, however, a more probable conjecture
that the young man was endeavoring to reach
the margin of the passage, where a good deal of
rock was above water, and near to which he had
already managed to reach. At one time Jack saw
that the mate was obliged to swim, and he actually
lost sight of him for a time. His form, however, reappeared,
and then it slowly emerged from the
water, and stood erect on a bare rock of some extent.
Jack breathed freer at this; for Mulford was
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
now on the very margin of the channel, and might
be easily reached by the boat, should he prevail on
Josh, or Simon, to attempt the rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first, Jack Tier fancied that Mulford had knelt
to return thanks on his arrival at a place of comparative
safety; but a second look satisfied him that
Harry was drinking from one of the little pools of
fresh water left by the late shower. When he rose
from drinking, the young man walked about the
place, occasionally stooping, signs that he was picking
up shell-fish for his supper. Suddenly, Mulford
darted forward, and passed beyond the field of the
glass. When Jack found him again, he was in the
act of turning a small turtle, using his knife on the
animal immediately after. Had Jack been in danger
of starvation himself, and found a source of food as
ample and as grateful as this, he could scarcely have
been more delighted. The light now began to wane
perceptibly, still Harry’s movements could be discerned.
The turtle was killed and dressed, sufficiently
at least for the mate’s purposes, and the latter
was seen collecting sea-weed, and bits of plank,
boards, and sticks of wood, of which more or less
in drifting past, had lodged upon the rocks. “Is it
possible,” thought Jack, “that he is so werry partic’lar
he can’t eat his turtle raw! Will he, indeed,
venture to light a fire, or has he the means?” Mulford
was so particular, however, he did venture to
light a fire, and he had the means. This may be
said to be the age of matches—not in a connubial,
though in an inflammatory sense—and the mate had
a small stock in a tight box that he habitually carried
on his person. Tier saw him at work over a
little pile he had made for a long time, the beams of
day departing now so fast as to make him fearful
he should soon lose his object in the increasing
obscurity of twilight. Suddenly a light gleamed,
and the pile sent forth a clear flame. Mulford went
to and fro, collecting materials to feed his fire, and
was soon busied in cooking his turtle. All this Tier
saw and understood, the light of the flames coming
in proper time to supply the vacuum left by the departure
of that of day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a minute Tier had no difficulty in seeing the
fire that Mulford had lighted on his low and insulated
domains with the naked eye. It gleamed brightly
in that solitary place; and the steward was much
afraid it would be seen by some one on deck, get to
be reported to Spike, and lead to Harry’s destruction
after all. The mate appeared to be insensible
to his danger, however, occasionally casting piles of
dry sea-weed on his fire, in a way to cause the
flames to flash up, as if kindled anew by gun-powder.
It now occurred to Tier that the young
man had a double object in lighting this fire, which
would answer not only the purposes of his cookery,
but as a signal of distress to any thing passing near.
The sloop-of war, though more distant than the brig,
was in his neighborhood; and she might possibly
yet send relief. Such was the state of things when
Jack was startled by a sudden hail from below.
It was in Spike’s voice, and came up to him short
and quick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fore-topmast cross-trees, there! What are ye
about all this time, Master Jack Tier, in them fore-topmast
cross-trees, I say?” demanded Spike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keeping a look-out for boats from the sloop-of-war,
as you bade me, sir,” answered Jack, coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’ye see any, my man? Is the water clear,
ahead of us, or not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s getting to be so dark, sir, I can see no longer.
While there was day-light, no boat was to be seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come down, man—come down; I’ve business
for you below. The sloop is far enough to the
nor’ard, and we shall neither see nor hear from her
to-night. Come down, I say, Jack—come down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack obeyed, and securing the glass, he began to
descend the rigging. He was soon as low as the
top, when he paused a moment to take another
look. The fire was still visible, shining like a torch
on the surface of the water, casting its beams abroad
like “a good deed in a naughty world.” Jack was
sorry to see it, though he once more took its bearing
from the brig, in order that he might know where to
find the spot, in the event of a search for it. When
on the stretcher of the fore-rigging, Jack stopped,
and again looked for his beacon. It had disappeared,
having sunk below the circular formation of the
earth. By ascending two or three ratlins, it came
into view, and by going down as low as the stretcher
again, it disappeared. Trusting that no one, at that
hour, would have occasion to go aloft, Jack now
descended to the deck, and went aft with the spy-glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike and the Señor Montefalderon were under
the coach-house, no one else appearing on any part
of the quarter-deck. The people were eating their
suppers, and Josh and Simon were busy in the
galley. As for the females, they chose to remain in
their own cabin, where Spike was well pleased to
leave them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come this way, Jack,” said the captain, in his
best-humored tone of voice, “I’ve a word to say to
you. Put the glass in at my state-room window,
and come hither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tier did as ordered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you can make out no boats to the nor’ard, ha,
Jack! Nothing to be seen thereaway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing in the way of a boat, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, I dare say there’s plenty of water, and
some rock. The Florida Reef has no scarcity of
either, to them that knows where to look for one,
and to steer clear of the other. Hark ’e, Jack; so
you got the schooner under way from the Dry Tortugas,
and undertook to beat her up to Key West,
when she fancied herself a turtle, and over she
went with you—is that it, my man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The schooner turned turtle with us, sure
enough, sir; and we all came near drowning on
her bottom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No sharks in that latitude and longitude, eh
Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
“Plenty on ’em, sir; and I thought they would
have got us all, at one time. More than twenty
set of fins were in sight at once, for several hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could hardly have supplied the gentlemen
with a leg, or an arm, each. But where was the
boat all this time—you had the light-house boat in
tow, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She had been in tow, sir; but Madam Budd
talked so much dictionary to the painter, that it got
adrift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet I found you all in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very true, sir. Mr. Mulford swam quite a mile
to reach the rocks, and found the boat aground on
one on ’em. As soon as he got the boat, he made
sail, and came and took us off. We had reason to
thank God he could do so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike looked dark and thoughtful. He muttered
the words “swam,” and “rocks,” but was too cautious
to allow any expressions to escape him, that
might betray to the Mexican officer that which was
uppermost in his mind. He was silent, however,
for quite a minute, and Jack saw that he had
awakened a dangerous source of distrust in the
captain’s breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Jack,” resumed Spike, after the pause,
“can you tell us any thing of the doubloons. I
nat’rally expected to find them in the boat, but
there were none to be seen. You scarcely pumped
the schooner out, without overhauling her lockers,
and falling in with them doubloons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We found them, sure enough, and had them
ashore with us, in the tent, down to the moment
when we sailed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you took them off to the schooner, eh?
My life for it, the gold was not forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not, sure enough, sir; but we took it off
with us to the schooner, and it went down in her
when she finally sunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another pause, during which Señor Montefalderon
and Capt. Spike looked significantly at each
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think, Jack, you could find the spot
where the schooner went down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could come pretty near it, sir, though not on
the very spot itself. Water leaves no mark over
the grave of a sunken ship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can take us within a reasonable distance,
we might find it by sweeping for it. Them doubloons
are worth some trouble; and their recovery
would be better than a long v’y’ge to us, any day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They would, indeed, Don Esteban,” observed
the Mexican; “and my poor country is not in a condition
to bear heavy losses. If Señor Jack Tier
can find the wreck, and we regain the money, ten
of those doubloons shall be his reward, though I
take them from my own share, much diminished
as it will be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hear, Jack—here is a chance to make your
fortune! You say you sailed with me in old times—and
old times were good times with this brig, though
times has changed; but if you sailed with me, in
<span class='it'>old</span> times, you must remember that whatever the
Swash touched she turned to gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you don’t doubt, Capt. Spike, my having
sailed in the brig, not only in old times, but in her
best times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack seemed hurt as he put this question, and
Spike appeared in doubt. The latter gazed at the
little, rotund, queer-looking figure before him, as if
endeavoring to recognize him; and when he had
done, he passed his hand over his brow, like one
who endeavored to recall past objects, by excluding
those that are present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will then show us the spot where my unfortunate
schooner did sink, Señor Jack Tier?” put
in the Mexican.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With all my heart, señor, if it is to be found. I
think I could take you within a cable’s length of the
place, though hunger, and thirst, and sharks, and the
fear of drowning, will keep a fellow from having a
very bright look-out for such a matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what water do you suppose the craft to lie,
Jack?” demanded the captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know as much of that as I do myself sir.
She went down about a cable’s length from the reef
toward which she was a settin’ at the time; and
had she kept afloat an hour longer, she might have
grounded on the rocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s better where she is, if we can only find
her by sweeping. On the rocks we could do nothing
with her but break her up, and ten to one the doubloons
would be lost. By the way, Jack, do you
happen to know where that scoundrel of a mate of
mine stowed the money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When we left the island, I carried it down to
the boat myself—and a good lift I had of it. As sure
as you are there, señor, I was obliged to take it on
a shoulder. When it came out of the boat, Mr.
Mulford carried it below; and I heard him tell Miss
Rose, a’terwards, that he had thrown it into a bread-locker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where we shall find it, Don Wan, notwithstanding
all this veering and hauling. The old
brig has luck, when doubloons are in question, and
ever has had since I’ve commanded her. Jack,
we shall have to call on the cook and stewards for
an anchor-watch to-night. The people are a good
deal fagged with boxing about this reef so much,
and I shall want ’em all as fresh to-morrow as they
can be got. You idlers had better take the middle
watches, which will give the forecastle chaps longer
naps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir; we’ll manage that for ’em. Josh
and Simon can go on at twelve, and I will take the
watch at two, which will give the men all the rest
they want, as I can hold out for four hours full.
I’m as good for an anchor-watch as any man in the
brig, Capt. Spike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you are, Jack, and better than some on
’em. Take you all round, and round it is, you’re
a rum ’un, my lad—the queerest little jigger that
ever lay out on a royal-yard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
Jack might have been a little offended at Spike’s
compliments, but he was certainly not sorry to find
him so good-natured, after all that had passed. He
now left the captain, and his Mexican companion,
seemingly in close conference together, while he
went below himself, and dropped as naturally into
the routine of his duty, as if he had never left the
brig. In the cabin he found the females, of course,
Rose scarce raising her face from the shawl which
lay on the bed of her own berth. Jack busied himself
in a locker near this berth, until an opportunity
occurred to touch Rose, unseen by her aunt or
Biddy. The poor heart-stricken girl raised her face,
from which all the color had departed, and looked
almost vacantly at Jack, as if to ask an explanation.
Hope is truly, by a most benevolent provision of
Providence, one of the very last blessings to abandon
us. It is probable that we are thus gifted, in
order to encourage us to rely on the great atonement
to the last moment, since, without this natural
endowment to cling to hope, despair might well be
the fate of millions, who, there is reason to think,
reap the benefit of that act of divine mercy. It
would hardly do to say that any thing like hope
was blended with the look Rose now cast on Jack,
but it was anxious and inquiring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The steward bent his head to the locker, bringing
his face quite near to that of Rose, and whispered—“There
is hope, Miss Rose—but do not betray me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These were blessed words for our heroine to
hear, and they produced an immediate and great
revolution in her feelings. Commanding herself,
however, she looked her questions, instead of trusting
even to a whisper. Jack did not say any more,
just then, but, shortly after, he called Rose, whose
eyes were now never off him, into the main cabin,
which was empty. It was so much pleasanter to
sleep in an airy state-room on deck, that Señor
Montefalderon, indeed, had given up the use of this
cabin, in a great measure, seldom appearing in it,
except at meals, having taken possession of the deserted
apartment of Mulford. Josh was in the
galley, where he spent most of his time, and Rose
and Jack had no one to disturb their conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is safe, Miss Rose—God be praised!” whispered
Jack. “Safe for the present, at least; with
food, and water, and fire to keep him warm at
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was impossible for Rose not to understand to
whom there was allusion, though her head became
dizzy under the painful confusion that prevailed in
it. She pressed her temples with both hands, and
asked a thousand questions with her eyes. Jack
considerately handed her a glass of water before he
proceeded. As soon as he found her a little more
composed, he related the facts connected with his
discovery of Mulford, precisely as they had occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is now on a large rock—a little island, indeed—where
he is safe from the ocean unless it
comes on to blow a hurricane,” concluded Jack,
“has fresh water and fresh turtle in the bargain. A
man might live a month on one such turtle as I saw
Mr. Mulford cutting up this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there no way of rescuing him from the situation
you have mentioned, Jack? In a year or two
I shall be my own mistress, and have money to do
as I please with; put me only in the way of taking
Mr. Mulford from that rock, and I will share all I
am worth on earth with you, dear Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, so it is with the whole sex,” muttered Tier;
“let them only once give up their affections to a
man, and he becomes dearer to them than pearls
and rubies! But you know me, Miss Rose, and
know <span class='it'>why</span> and <span class='it'>how well</span> I would sarve you. My
story and my feelin’s are as much your secret, as
your story and your feelin’s is mine. We shall pull
together, if we don’t pull so very strong. Now,
hearken to me, Miss Rose, and I will let you into
the secret of my plan to help Mr. Mulford make a
launch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack then communicated to his companion his
whole project for the night. Spike had, of his own
accord, given to him and his two associates, Simon
and Josh, the care of the brig between midnight and
morning. If he could prevail on either of these men
to accompany him, it was his intention to take the
light-house boat, which was riding by its painter
astern of the brig, and proceed as fast as they could
to the spot whither Mulford had found his way. By
his calculations, if the wind stood as it then was,
little more than an hour would be necessary to
reach the rock, and about as much more to return.
Should the breeze lull, of which there was no great
danger, since the easterly trades were again blowing,
Jack thought he and Josh might go over the
distance with the oars in about double the time.
Should both Josh and Simon refuse to accompany
him, he thought he should attempt the rescue of the
mate alone, did the wind stand, trusting to Mulford’s
assistance, should he need it, in getting back to the
brig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You surely would not come back here with
Harry, did you once get him safe from off that rock!”
exclaimed Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you know how it is with me, Miss Rose,”
answered Jack. “<span class='it'>My</span> business is here, on board
the Swash, and I must attend to it. Nothing shall
tempt me to give up the brig so long as she floats,
and sartain folk float in her, unless it might be some
such matter as that which happened on the bit of
an island at the Dry Tortugas. Ah! he’s a willian!
But if I do come back, it will be only to get into my
own proper berth ag’in, and not to bring Mr. Mulford
into the lion’s jaws. He will only have to put
me back on board the Molly here, when he can
make the best of his own way to Key West. Half
an hour would place him out of harm’s way; especially
as I happen to know the course Spike means
to steer in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go with you, Jack,” said Rose, mildly, but
with great firmness.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
“You, Miss Rose! But why should I show surprise?
It’s like all the sex, when they have given
away their affections. Yes, woman will be woman,
put her on a naked rock, or put her in silks and
satins in her parlor at home. How different is it
with men! They dote for a little while, and turn to
a new face. It must be said, men’s willians!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not Mulford, Jack—no, not Harry Mulford! A
truer or a nobler heart never beat in a human
breast; and you and I will drown together, rather
than he should not be taken from that rock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall be as you say,” answered Jack, a little
thoughtfully. “Perhaps it would be best that you
should quit the brig altogether. Spike is getting
desperate, and you will be safer with the young
mate than with so great an old willian. Yes, you
shall go with me, Miss Rose; and if Josh and Simon
both refuse we will go alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With you, Jack, but not with Mr. Mulford. I
cannot desert my aunt, nor can I quit the Swash
alone in company with her mate. As for Spike, I
despise him too much to fear him. He must soon
go into port somewhere, and at the first place where
he touches we shall quit him. He dare not detain
us—nay, he <span class='it'>cannot</span>—and I do not fear him. We
will save Harry, but I shall remain with my aunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see, Miss Rose, we’ll see,” said Tier,
smiling. “Perhaps a handsome young man, like
Mr. Mulford, will have better luck in persuading
you than an old fellow like me. If he should fail,
’twill be his own fault.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So thought Jack Tier, judging of women as he
had found them, but so did not think Rose Budd.
The conversation ended here, however, each keeping
in view its purport, and the serious business
that was before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duty of the vessel went on as usual. The
night promised to be clouded, but not very dark,
as there was a moon. When Spike ordered the
anchor-watches, he had great care to spare his
crew as much as possible, for the next day was
likely to be one of great toil to them. He intended
to get the schooner up again, if possible; and though
he might not actually pump her out so as to cause
her to float, enough water was to be removed to
enable him to get at the doubloons. The situation
of the bread-locker was known, and as soon as the
cabin was sufficiently freed from water to enable
one to move about in it, Spike did not doubt his
being able to get at the gold. With his resources
and ingenuity, the matter in his own mind was reduced
to one of toil and time. Eight-and-forty hours,
and some hard labor, he doubted not would effect
all he cared for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In setting the anchor-watches for the night, therefore,
Stephen Spike bethought him as much of the
morrow as of the present moment. Don Juan offered
to remain on deck until midnight, and as he was as
capable of giving an alarm as any one else, the offer
was accepted. Josh and Simon were to succeed
the Mexican, and to hold the look-out for two hours,
when Jack was to relieve them, and to continue on
deck until light returned, when he was to give the
captain a call. This arrangement made, Tier turned
in at once, desiring the cook to call him half an hour
before the proper period of his watch commenced.
That half hour Jack intended to employ in exercising
his eloquence in endeavoring to persuade either
Josh or Simon to be of his party. By eight o’clock
the vessel lay in a profound quiet, Señor Montefalderon
pacing the quarter-deck alone, while the deep
breathing of Spike was to be heard issuing through
the open window of his state-room; a window
which, it may be well to say to the uninitiated,
opened in-board, or toward the deck, and not out-board,
or toward the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For four solitary hours did the Mexican pace the
deck of the stranger, resting himself for a few
minutes at a time only, when wearied with walking.
Does the reader fancy that a man so situated had
not plenty of occupation for his thoughts? Don
Juan Montefalderon was a soldier and a gallant
cavalier; and love of country had alone induced him
to engage in his present duties. Not that patriotism
which looks to political preferment through a popularity
purchased by the vulgar acclamation which
attends success in arms, even when undeserved, or
that patriotism which induces men of fallen characters
to endeavor to retrieve former offences by the
shortest and most reckless mode, or that patriotism
which shouts “our country, right or wrong,” regardless
alike of God and his eternal laws, that are
never to be forgotten with impunity; but the patriotism
which would defend his home and fire-side,
his altars and the graves of his fathers, from the
ruthless steps of the invader. We shall not pretend
to say how far this gentleman entered into the
merits of the quarrel between the two republics,
which no arts of European jealousy can ever conceal
from the judgment of truth, for, with him, matters
had gone beyond the point when men feel the
necessity of reasoning, and when, perhaps, if such
a condition of the mind is ever to be defended, he
found his perfect justification in feeling. He had
traveled, and knew life by observation, and not
through traditions and books. He had never believed,
therefore, that his countrymen could march
to Washington, or even to the Sabine; but he had
hoped for better things than had since occurred.
The warlike qualities of the Americans of the North,
as he was accustomed to call those who term themselves,
<span class='it'>par excellence</span>, Americans, a name they are
fated to retain, and to raise high on the scale of national
power and national preeminence, unless they
fall by their own hands, had taken him by surprise,
as they have taken all but those who knew the
country well, and who understood its people. Little
had he imagined that the small, widely spread body
of regulars, that figured in the blue-books, almanacs
and army-registers of America, as some six or seven
thousand men, scattered along frontiers of a thousand
leagues in extent, could, at the beck of the
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
government, swell into legions of invaders, men
able to carry war to the capitals of his own states,
thousands of miles from their doors, and formidable
alike for their energy, their bravery, their readiness
in the use of arms, and their numbers. He saw
what is perhaps justly called the boasting of the
American character, vindicated by their exploits;
and marches, conquests and victories that, if sober
truth were alone to cover the pages of history,
would far outdo in real labor and danger the boasted
passage of the Alps, under Napoleon, and the exploits
that succeeded it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Juan Montefalderon was a grave and
thoughtful man, of pure Iberian blood. He might
have had about him a little of the exaltation of the
Spanish character; the overflowings of a generous
chivalry at the bottom; and, under its influence, he
may have set too high an estimate on Mexico and
her sons, but he was not one to shut his eyes to the
truth. He saw plainly that the northern neighbors
of his country were a race formidable and enterprising,
and that of all the calumnies that had been
heaped upon them by rivalries and European superciliousness,
that of their not being military by temperament
was, perhaps, the most absurd of all. On
the contrary, he had himself, though anticipating
evil, been astounded by the suddenness and magnitude
of their conquests, which, in a few short
months after the breaking out of hostilities, had
overrun regions larger than many ancient empires.
All this had been done, too, not by disorderly and
barbarous hordes, seeking abroad the abundance
that was wanting at home; but with system and
regularity, by men who had turned the ploughshare
into the sword for the occasion, quitting abundance
to encounter fatigue, famine and danger. In a word,
the Señor Montefalderon saw all the evils that
environed his own land, and foresaw others, of a
still graver character, that menaced the future. On
matters such as these did he brood in his walk, and
bitter did he find the minutes of that sad and lonely
watch. Although a Mexican, he could feel; although
an avowed foe of this good republic of ours, he had
his principles, his affections, and his sense of right.
Whatever may be the merits of the quarrel, and
we are not disposed to deny that our provocation
has been great, a sense of right should teach every
man that what may be patriotic in an American,
would not be exactly the same thing in a Mexican,
and that we ought to respect in others sentiments
that are so much vaunted among ourselves. Midnight
at length arrived, and, calling the cook and
steward, the unhappy gentleman was relieved, and
went to his berth to dream, in sorrow, over the
same pictures of national misfortunes, on which,
while waking, he had brooded in such deep melancholy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The watch of Josh and Simon was tranquil, meeting
with no interruption until it was time to summon
Jack. One thing these men had done, however,
that was of some moment to Tier, under a pledge
given by Josh, and which had been taken in return
for a dollar in hand. They had managed to haul
the light-house boat alongside, from its position
astern, and this so noiselessly as not to give the
alarm to any one. There it lay, when Jack appeared,
ready at the main-rigging to receive him at
any moment he might choose to enter it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes after Jack appeared on deck, Rose
and Biddy came stealthily out of the cabin, the latter
carrying a basket filled with bread and broken meat,
and not wanting in sundry little delicacies, such as
woman’s hands prepare, and, in this instance, woman’s
tenderness had provided. The whole party
met at the galley, a place so far removed from the
state-rooms aft as to be out of ear-shot. Here Jack
renewed his endeavors to persuade either Josh or
Simon to go in the boat, but without success. The
negroes had talked the matter over together in their
watch, and had come to the conclusion the enterprise
was too hazardous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you, Jack, you doesn’t know Capt. Spike
as well as I does,” Josh said, in continuance of the
discourse. “No, you doesn’t know him at all as
well as I does. If he finds out that anybody has quit
dis brig dis werry night, woful will come! It no
good to try to run; I run t’ree time, an’ Simon here
run twice. What good it all do? We got cotched,
and here we is, just as fast as ever. I knows Capt.
Spike, and doesn’t want to fall in athwart his hawse
any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Y-e-s dat my judgment, too,” put in the cook.
“We wishes you well, Jack, and we wishes Miss
Rose well, and Mr. Mulford well, but we can’t, no
how, run ath’art hawse, as Josh says. Dat is my
judgment, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if your minds are made up to this, my
darkies, I s’pose there’ll be no changing them,” said
Jack. “At all ewents you’ll lend us a hand, by answering
any hail that may come from aft, in my
watch, and in keepin’ our secret. There’s another
thing you can do for us, which may be of sarvice.
Should Capt. Spike miss the boat, and lay any trap
to catch us, you can just light this here bit of lantern
and hang it over the brig’s bows, where he’ll not be
likely to see it, that we may know matters are going
wrong, and give the craft a wide berth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sartain,” said Josh, who entered heartily into
the affair, so far as good wishes for its success were
concerned, at the very moment when he had a
most salutary care of his own back. “Sartain; we
do all dat, and no t’ank asked. It no great matter
to answer a hail, or to light a lantern and sling him
over de bows; and if Capt. Spike want to know
who did it, let him find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here both negroes laughed heartily, manifesting
so little care to suppress their mirth, that Rose
trembled lest their noise should awaken Spike.
Accustomed sounds, however, seldom produce this
effect on the ears of the sleeper, and the heavy
breathing from the state-room succeeded the merriment
of the blacks, as soon as the latter ceased.
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
Jack now announced his readiness to depart. Some
little care and management were necessary to get
into the boat noiselessly, more especially with
Biddy. It was done, however, with the assistance
of the blacks, who cast off the painter, when Jack
gave the boat a shove to clear the brig, and suffered
it to drift astern for a considerable distance before
he ventured to cast loose the sail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know Spike well,” said Jack, in answer to a
remonstrance from the impatient Rose concerning
his delay. “A single flap of that canvas would
wake him up, with the brig anchored, while he
would sleep through a salute of heavy guns if it
came in regular course. Quick ears has old Stephen,
and it’s best to humor them. In a minute
more, we’ll set our canvas and be off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All was done as Jack desired, and the boat got
away from the brig unheard and undetected. It
was blowing a good breeze, and Jack Tier had no
sooner got the sail on the boat, than away it started
at a speed that would have soon distanced Spike in
his yawl, and with his best oarsmen. The main
point was to keep the course, though the direction
of the wind was a great assistant. By keeping the
wind abeam, Jack thought he should be going toward
the rock of Mulford. In one hour, or even in
less time, he expected to reach it, and he was
guided by time, in his calculations, as much as by
any other criterion. Previously to quitting the brig,
he had gone up a few ratlins of the fore-rigging to
take the bearings of the fire on Mulford’s rock, but
the light was no longer visible. As no star was to
be seen, the course was a little vague, but Jack was
navigator enough to understand that by keeping on
the weather side of the channel he was in the right
road, and that his great danger of missing his object
was in over-running it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much of the reef was above water, that it was
not difficult to steer a boat along its margin. The
darkness, to be sure, rendered it a little uncertain
how near they were running to the rocks, but, on
the whole, Jack assured Rose he had no great difficulty
in getting along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These trades are almost as good as compasses,”
he said, “and the rocks are better, if we can keep
close aboard them without going on to them. I do
not know the exact distance of the spot we seek
from the brig, but I judged it to be about two leagues,
as I looked at it from aloft. Now, this boat will
travel them two leagues in an hour, with this breeze
and in smooth water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you had seen the fire again before we
left the brig,” said Rose, too anxious for the result
not to feel uneasiness on some account or other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mate is asleep, and the fire has burnt down;
that’s the explanation. Besides, fuel is not too
plenty on a place like that Mr. Mulford inhabits just
now. As we get near the spot I shall look out for
embers, which may sarve as a light-house, or beacon,
to guide us into port.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Mulford will be charmed to see us, now
that we take him wather!” exclaimed Biddy. “Wather
is a blessed thing, and it’s hard will be the
heart that does not fale gratitude for a plenthy of
swate wather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The maty has plenty of food and water where
he is,” said Jack. “I’ll answer for both them sarcumstances.
I saw him turn a turtle as plain as if
I had been at his elbow, and I saw him drinking at
a hole in the rock, as heartily as a boy ever pulled
at a gimblet-hole in a molasses hogshead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the distance was so great, Jack, I should
hardly think you could have distinguished objects
so small.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went by the motions altogether. I saw the
man, and I saw the movements, and I knowed what
the last meant. It’s true I couldn’t swear to the
turtle, though I saw something on the rock that I
knowed, by the way in which it was handled, <span class='it'>must</span>
be a turtle. Then I saw the mate kneel, and put
his head low, and then I knowed he was drinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he prayed,” said Rose, solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not he. Sailors isn’t so apt to pray, Miss Rose;
not as apt as they ought to be. Women for prayers,
and men for work. Mr. Mulford is no worse than
many others, but I doubt if he be much given to
<span class='it'>that</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this Rose made no answer, but Biddy took
the matter up, and, as the boat went briskly ahead,
she pursued the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then more is the shame for him,” said the Irish
woman, “and Miss Rose, and missus, and even I
prayin’ <span class='it'>for</span> him, all as if he was our own brudder.
It’s seldom I ask any thing for a heretic, but I could
not forget a fine young man like Mr. Mulford, and
Miss Rose so partial to him, and he in so bad a
way. He ought to be ashamed to make his brags
that he is too proud to pray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry has made no such wicked boast,” put in
Rose, mildly; “nor do we know that he has not
prayed for us, as well as for himself. It may all be
a mistake of Jack’s, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” added Jack, coolly, “it <span class='it'>may</span> be a mistake,
a’ter all, for I was lookin’ at the maty six miles off,
and through a spy-glass. No one can be sure of
any thing at such a distance. So overlook the matter,
my good Biddy, and carry Mr. Mulford the nice
things you’ve mustered in that basket, all the same
as if he was pope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a subject we had better drop,” Rose
quietly observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any thing to oblige you, Miss Rose, though religion
is a matter it would do me no harm to talk
about once and awhile. It’s many a long year
since I’ve had time and opportunity to bring my
thoughts to dwell on holy things. Ever since I left
my mother’s side, I’ve been a wanderer in my mind,
as much as in my body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Jack! I understand and feel for your sufferings;
but a better time will come, when you may
return to the habits of your youth, and to the observances
of your church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
“I don’t know that, Miss Rose; I don’t know
that,” answered Tier, placing the elbow of his short
arm on the knee of a seemingly shorter leg, and
bending his head so low as to lean his face on the
palm of the hand, an attitude in which he appeared
to be suffering keenly through his recollections.
“Childhood and innocence never come back to us
in this world. What the grave may do we shall all
learn in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Innocence can return to all with repentance,
Jack; and the heart that prompts you to do acts as
generous as this you are now engaged in, must contain
some good seed yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Jack will go to a praste and just confess,
when he can find a father, it will do his sowl good,”
said Biddy, who was touched by the mental suffering
of the strange little being at her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the necessity of managing the boat soon compelled
its cockswain to raise his head, and to attend
to his duty. The wind sometimes came in puffs,
and at such moments Jack saw that the large sail of
the light-house boat required watching, a circumstance
that induced him to shake off his melancholy,
and give his mind more exclusively to the business
before him. As for Rose, she sympathized deeply
with Jack Tier, for she knew his history, his origin,
the story of his youth, and the well-grounded causes
of his contrition and regrets. From her, Jack had
concealed nothing, the gentle commisseration of one
like Rose being a balm to wounds that had bled for
long and bitter years. The great poet of our language,
and the greatest that ever lived, perhaps,
short of the inspired writers of the Old Testament,
and old Homer and Dante, has well reminded us
that the “little beetle,” in yielding its breath, can
“feel a pang as great as when a giant dies.” Thus
is it, too, in morals. Abasement, and misery, and
poverty, and sin, may, and all do, contribute to
lower the tone of our moral existence; but the principle
that has been planted by nature, can be eradicated
by nature only. It exists as long as we exist;
and if dormant for a time, under the pressure of
circumstances, it merely lies, in the moral system,
like the acorn, or the chestnut, in the ground, waiting
its time and season to sprout, and bud, and blossom.
Should that time never arrive, it is not because the
seed is not there, but because it is neglected. Thus
was it with the singular being of whose feelings we
have just spoken. The germ of goodness had been
implanted early in him, and was nursed with tenderness
and care, until self-willed, and governed by
passion, he had thrown off the connections of youth
and childhood, to connect himself with Spike—a
connection that had left him what he was. Before
closing our legend, we shall have occasion to explain
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have run our hour, Miss Rose,” resumed
Jack, breaking a continued silence, during which
the boat had passed through a long line of water;
“we have run our hour, and ought to be near the
rock we are in search of. But the morning is so
dark that I fear we shall have difficulty in finding it.
It will never do to run past it, and we must haul
closer in to the reef, and shorten sail, that we may
be sartain to make no such mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose begged her companion to omit no precaution,
as it would be dreadful to fail in their search,
after incurring so much risk in their own persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry may be sleeping on the sea-weed of which
you spoke,” she added, “and the danger of passing
him will be much increased in such a case. What
a gloomy and frightful spot is this in which to
abandon a human being. I fear, Jack, that we have
come faster than we have supposed, and may already
have passed the rock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope not, Miss Rose—it seemed to me a good
two leagues to the place where I saw him, and the
boat is fast that will run two leagues in an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do not know the time, Jack, and are obliged
to guess at that as well as at the distance. How
very dark it is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dark, in one sense, it was not, though Rose’s apprehensions,
doubtless, induced her to magnify every
evil. The clouds certainly lessened the light of the
moon; but there was still enough of the last to
enable one to see surrounding objects; and most
especially to render distinct the character of the
solitude that reigned over the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proximity of the reef which formed a weather
shore to the boat, prevented any thing like a swell
on the water, notwithstanding the steadiness and
strength of the breeze, which had now blown for
near twenty-four hours. The same wind, in open
water, would have raised sea enough to cause a
ship to pitch, or roll, whereas, the light-house boat,
placed where she was, scarce rose and fell under
the undulations of the channel through which she
was glancing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a good boat, and a fast boat too,” observed
Jack Tier, after he had luffed up several minutes,
in order to make sure of his proximity to the reef;
“and it might carry us all safe enough to Key West,
or certainly back to the Dry Tortugas, was we inclined
to try our hands at either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot quit my aunt,” said Rose, quickly, “so
we will not even think of any such thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ’twould never do to abandon the missus,”
said Biddy, “and she on the wrack wid us, and
falin’ the want of wather as much as ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We three have sartainly gone through much in
company,” returned Jack, “and it ought to make us
friends for life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust it will, Jack; I hope, when we return to
New York, to see you among us, anchored, as you
would call it, for the rest of your days under my
aunt’s roof, or under my own, should I ever have
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Miss Rose, my business is with the Swash
and her captain. I shall stick by both, now I’ve
found ’em again, until they once more desart me.
A man’s duty is <span class='it'>his</span> duty, and a woman’s duty is
<span class='it'>her</span> duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
“You same to like the brig and her captain, Jack
Tier,” observed Biddy, “and there’s no use in gain-saying
such a likin’. What <span class='it'>will</span> come to pass, must
come to pass. Capt. Spike is a mighty great sailor,
anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a willian!” muttered Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” cried Rose, almost breathless, “there is
a rock above the water, surely. Do not fly by it so
swiftly, Jack, but let us stop and examine it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a rock, sure enough, and a large piece
it is,” answered Tier. “We will go alongside of it,
and see what it is made of. Biddy shall be boat-keeper,
while you and I, Miss Rose, explore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack had thrown the boat into the wind, and was
shooting close alongside of the reef, even while
speaking. The party found no difficulty in landing;
the margin of the rock admitting the boat to lie
close alongside of it, and its surface being even and
dry. Jack had brailed the sail, and he brought the
painter ashore, and fastened it securely to a fragment
of stone, that made a very sufficient anchor.
In addition to this precaution, a lazy painter was put
into Biddy’s hands, and she was directed not to let
go of it while her companions were absent. These
arrangements concluded, Rose and Jack commenced
a hurried examination of the spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes sufficed to give our adventurers a
tolerably accurate notion of the general features of
the place on which they had landed. It was a considerable
portion of the reef that was usually above
water, and which had even some fragments of soil,
or sand, on which was a stinted growth of bushes.
Of these last, however, there were very few, nor
were there many spots of the sand. Drift-wood and
sea-weed were lodged in considerable quantities
about its margin, and, in places, piles of both had
been tossed upon the rock itself, by the billows of
former gales of wind. Nor was it long before Jack
discovered a turtle that had been up to a hillock of
sand, probably to deposit its eggs. There was
enough of the sportsman in Jack, notwithstanding
the business he was on, to turn this animal; though
with what object, he might have been puzzled himself
to say. This exploit effected, Jack followed
Rose as fast as his short legs would permit, our
heroine pressing forward eagerly, though almost
without hope, in order to ascertain if Mulford
were there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid this is not the rock,” said Rose,
nearly breathless with her own haste, when Jack
had overtaken her. “I see nothing of him, and we
have passed over most of the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very true, Miss Rose,” answered her companion,
who was in a good humor on account of his capture
of the turtle; “but there are other rocks besides this.
Ha! what was that, yonder,” pointing with a finger,
“here, more toward the brig. As I’m a sinner, there
was a flashing, as of fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a fire, it must be that made by Harry. Let us
go to the spot at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack led the way, and, sure enough, he soon
reached a place where the embers of what had been
a considerable body of fire, were smouldering on
the rock. The wind had probably caused some
brand to kindle momentarily, which was the object
that had caught Tier’s eye. No doubt any longer
remained of their having found the very place where
the mate had cooked his supper, and lighted his
beacon, though he himself was not near it. Around
these embers were all the signs of Mulford’s having
made the meal, of which Jack had seen the preparations.
A portion of the turtle, much the greater
part of it, indeed, lay in its shell; and piles of wood and
sea-weed, both dry, had been placed at hand, ready
for use. A ship’s topgallant-yard, with most of its
ropes attached, lay with a charred end near the fire,
or where the fire had been, the wood having burned
until the flames went out for want of contact with
other fuel. There were many pieces of boards of
pitch-pine in the adjacent heap, and two or three
beautiful planks of the same wood, entire. In short,
from the character and quantity of the materials of
this nature that had thus been heaped together,
Jack gave it as his opinion that some vessel, freighted
with lumber, had been wrecked to windward, and
that the adjacent rocks had been receiving the
tribute of her cargo. Wrecks are of very, very
frequent occurrence on the Florida Reef; and there
are always moments when such gleanings are to
be made in some part of it or other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see no better way to give a call to the mate,
Miss Rose, than to throw some of this dry weed, and
some of this lumber on the fire,” said Jack, after he
had rummaged about the place sufficiently to become
master of its condition. “There is plenty of ammunition,
and here goes for a broadside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack had no great difficulty in effecting his object.
In a few minutes he succeeded in obtaining a flame,
and then he fed it with such fragments of the brands
and boards as were best adapted to his purpose.
The flames extended gradually, and by the time Tier
had dragged the topgallant-yard over the pile, and
placed several plank, on their edges, alongside of it,
the whole was ready to burst into a blaze. The
light was shed athwart the rock for a long distance,
and the whole place, which was lately so gloomy
and obscure, now became gay, under the bright
radiance of a blazing fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a beacon-light that might almost be seen
on board!” said Jack, exulting in his success. “If the
mate is anywhere in this latitude, he will soon turn up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see nothing of him,” answered Rose, in a melancholy
voice. “Surely, surely, Jack, he cannot have
left the rock just as we have come to rescue him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose and her companion had turned their faces
from the fire to look in an opposite direction in quest
of him they sought. Unseen by them, a human form
advanced swiftly toward the fire, from a point on its
other side. It advanced nearer, then hesitated, afterward
rushed forward with a tread that caused the
two to turn, and at the next moment, Rose was
clasped to the heart of Mulford.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was at the beginning of my third year at boarding-school,
that—being at the time a parlor-boarder—I
was called down one day into the drawing-room,
to be introduced to a new scholar, who had just
arrived. Upon entering, I perceived a young girl
of apparently sixteen or seventeen years of age,
seated upon an ottoman, and weeping bitterly.
She did not raise her head until Madame B——,
calling me by name, introduced the stranger to me,
as Miss Grahame. The poor girl, whose parents I
found had just left her, merely removed her handkerchief
from her face, and bowed slightly, without
looking at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ellen,” said Madame B—— to me, “Miss
Grahame will share your room; perhaps she would
like to be shown to it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I approached, and taking the young girl’s unresisting
hand, whispered a few words of encouragement,
and led her up stairs to my little sanctum, where,
after having assisted her in removing her hat and
shawl, I left her, judging by my own experience
that she would prefer being alone for a short
time. About two hours after, as I was walking in
the garden, I heard a soft, sweet voice call me by
name. I turned, and saw my new room-mate, who,
approaching, extended her hand, and said, in a
trembling tone, “You must have thought me very
rude, when you were so kind to me; but, indeed, I
never was so unhappy before. I feel better now,
and have come to ask pardon, and hope to be taken
into favor.” It was impossible to resist her sad,
winning look, and, with my usual impetuosity, I
flung my arms around her, and pressed her to my
bosom. From that moment we were sworn friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evelyn was just sixteen; and never did a sweeter
face, or a warmer heart, animate a lovely form. Her
features were not regularly beautiful, but the expression
of almost angelic purity which pervaded her
countenance, when in repose, made her more beautiful
than the most studied regularity of feature
could have done. The extreme gentleness of her
manners, the half-reluctant, half-confiding way she
had of speaking of herself, made me think her weak
and timid, until I knew her better. She was never
gay, but always cheerful; and never did I see her
polished brow ruffled by a frown. She was the
only child of fond and wealthy parents, residing in
Mobile; and the fame of Madame B——’s school
had induced them to leave her in New York
for a year, in order that she might finish her
education.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six months passed away, and Evelyn and myself
were still inseparable. We unfolded to each other
every secret of our hearts; and I often smile now to
think with how much importance we treated a
thousand trifling things. We would sit hours together
by the window in our little room, laying plans
for the future—that future so short and sad to my
sweet friend. Beloved Evelyn, dear companion,
thine was a sad lot, born to all that could make
life joyous, yet doomed to so cruel a fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one of our confidences, not long after her
arrival, she spoke to me of one very dear to her—a
cousin, a passed-midshipman in the navy. He had
spent several months with her family, and had sailed
on a short cruise to Brazil only a few days before
she left home; but ere they parted, he had won her
consent to an engagement, which was to be kept a
secret from all until her return from school. “He
will be home just about that time,” said she in conclusion;
“he will then tell father all, and we shall
be so happy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! how often does her image come before me,
as she stood and blushingly told me of her joyful
hopes. What a blessed thing it is that we know
not the trials the mysterious future may have in
store for us. We can at least be happy in anticipation;
and if our bright dreams are dissipated by a
dark and mournful reality, memory can still lessen
the gloom of many a lonely hour by recalling those
pleasant visions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six months, as I have said, passed away, each
day only endearing Evelyn Grahame more to my
heart. About this time she received letters from
home, announcing the death of Mrs. Grahame’s
only sister, Mrs. Dutton; and, also, that the latter’s
eldest child, a daughter, one year older than Evelyn,
had been adopted by her aunt. Mrs. Grahame
wrote in the most flattering manner concerning
Sarah Dutton; and from the letters the young girl
herself wrote Evelyn, I was led to entertain a high
opinion of her mind and heart. Evelyn had often
visited her aunt, and therefore knew her cousin
well. She often spoke to me in the warmest manner
of Sarah’s beauty and amiability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, Arthur Noel, Eva’s lover, remained
at sea; but the time was drawing near
when he would return. The months rolled swiftly
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
by; and as the period approached for her leaving
school, Evelyn became more impatient each day.
She was expecting her father to come on for her,
when a letter arrived, telling her that it was impossible
for him to leave his business, and that she
would be obliged to remain at school for a few weeks
longer, until some good opportunity offered for her
to reach home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eva was very much distressed at this. She felt
sure that Arthur would reach Mobile before her,
and she had promised to meet him there. But she
was forced to submit; and after some little persuasion,
consented to accompany me to my father’s
summer residence on the North River. She was
charmed with the scenery of the Hudson, and
arrived in much better spirits than I expected at
“Lily Grove”—the fanciful name my dear mother
had bestowed upon our dear, beautiful home. The
day after our arrival, Evelyn received a letter, which
had been forwarded to her from school, where it
was directed. It was from Arthur Noel, the first
she had ever received from him. How brightly her
eyes beamed as she read it. Fourteen months of
separation had failed to erase her image from his
heart. He was at Pensacola, and thinking she
would soon be on her return home, designed meeting
her in Mobile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, Ellen!” she exclaimed, when she had finished
reading the precious missive, “I never felt before
how truly, how devotedly I am his.” Poor Evelyn!
she loved with a woman’s first, deep, passionate
love—a love that either makes or mars her happiness—a
love that rude neglect may chill, but naught
but death destroy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next week brought my dear Eva another
tender letter. Arthur had reached Mobile, and
though much disappointed at not meeting her there,
felt obliged, he said, to smother his desire to fly to New
York for her, as so sudden a move, before he had
visited his own family, would cause “very unpleasant
remarks.” Evelyn was chagrined at this, and
so was I. We had both yet to learn how little of the
world’s opinion a man is willing to sacrifice for the
sake of the one he pretends to love. My friend said
little upon the subject, however; but I saw that she
anxiously awaited the coming of the following week,
when she felt sure of hearing again from her lover.
The week came, but brought disappointment—there
was no letter. Three weeks more of great anxiety
were passed, and still Evelyn heard nothing from
home. She was beginning to be seriously alarmed,
when one morning, at the beginning of the fourth
week, I flew to her room with a letter that the servant
had just brought from the village post-office.
She grasped it eagerly—the superscription was
Arthur’s. She broke the seal, but, as if a sudden
presentiment of evil had come over her, she laid it
down, and sinking into a chair, burst into tears.
“Ellen,” said she, “you must read it first—I have
not courage; I feel as if it contained bad news.” I
laughed at her, but she insisted upon my reading it
first. I took it up, opened it, and silently read as
follows: —</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='it'>Mobile, May 20, 18—.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dearest Eva</span>,—You will be surprised upon receiving
this, to find that I am still in your city instead
of being with my own family in New Orleans. But
you will, I fear, be pained to learn the object that
detains me. Oh, Eva! would to God we had never
met; or rather, would that I had died, ere I strove
to win your fond, pure heart to myself. But, Eva,
I know you well; beneath a gentleness which angels
might covet, you bear a proud, firm spirit; and I
know further, that you would rather learn the truth
now, painful as it may be, than some time hence,
when it would be too late to repair the evil. I came
here, my Eva, with a heart full of love and joy at
the prospect of seeing you again. I was disappointed,
most sincerely so, at not meeting you.
But another filled your place in the family circle—our
orphan cousin, Sarah. I will not say aught in
her praise, for you have seen and loved her; but—must
I confess it—day after day found me lingering
at her side, listening to the music of a voice that I
have never heard equaled; and, ere long, I learned
to know how sadly I had mistaken my feelings toward
you, Evelyn. Condemn me, curse me, if you
will—I love, madly love, Sarah! Oh, Evelyn! what
words to write to you my own, noble-hearted cousin;
but you may, perhaps, thank me for my candor.
As yet, I have not committed myself to Sarah—all
rests with you. To you I owe all my duty and my
hand; say but the word, dear Eva, and it is yours
forever. I do not ask you to release me from my
engagement; but, having told you all, shall most
anxiously expect your answer. My heart is breaking,
dear Eva, at the thought of the pain this may
cause you; but with your own brave spirit, cast
from you the image of one who is unworthy
of you; one who has so traitorously repaid your
love.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='sc'>Arthur Noel.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The letter had evidently been penned in a state
of great agitation. I thought it the wildest thing I
had ever read, but at the moment, indignation
mastered every other feeling. I continued silent
for some moments after I had finished reading it—for
I was too much distressed to speak. I did not
know how to break the matter to my friend. I knew
she had been watching my face for some seconds,
and my feelings must have revealed themselves
very strongly; for when she saw me standing so
long silent, she said, “Tell me what that letter contains,
to move you thus.” Her voice trembled as
she spoke, but seeing me still silent, she sprung toward
me, and grasping my hand, exclaimed, “have
mercy on me, Ellen. Tell me what it is; I can bear
all, any thing, so that Arthur is well!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is well, Evelyn,” said I; “it would be better
for you, poor girl, if he were dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! say not that,” she again exclaimed, “you
would have me think him false; but that cannot be.
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
Arthur loves me; oh, God! say that he loves me
still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sunk at my feet as she said this, and burying
her face in my dress, sobbed violently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evelyn,” I cried, endeavoring at the same time
to raise her, “Evelyn, you have a hard trial before
you, but one which I know your woman’s pride
will enable you to bear with fortitude. I will leave
you; read that letter yourself, and when I come
again in an hour, let me find that my friend has
been true to herself.” I gently disengaged my dress
from her clasp, placed the letter in her hand, kissed
her cheek, and left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I retired to my own room, and there wept for my
friend, as I had never wept for myself. I trembled
for the consequences that might ensue. I knew
how deeply Arthur was beloved; and I could not
but fear that even Eva’s firm spirit would not bear
the blow with fortitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an hour I knocked at her door, and called her
by name. “Do not come in yet,” she said, but in a
voice so hoarse and hollow, that I could scarcely
believe it hers; “do not come in yet, I am not what
you wish to see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again that morning I attempted to see her,
but she still refused to admit me; and it was not until
eight o’clock in the evening that my maid came and
told me that Evelyn wished to see me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never, never shall I forget the look with which
she received me. Her color was more brilliant than
I had ever seen it, but her eyes were dull and fixed,
and a ghastly smile played round her mouth, as she
bade me enter; but the expression of her forehead,
if I may use such a term, shocked me more than all
else. It seemed to have grown old—twenty years
in advance of the rest of her face. It was wrinkled,
and literally old, with the agony of thought she endured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ellen,” said she, in the same hollow tone with
which she had addressed me at the door, “Ellen, I
have sent for you, to ask you where is now all
my boasted firmness; where my pride, my dignity?
Ah, Ellen! I was never tried before. You think me
calm—despair makes me so. I did not arrive at
despair even without a hard struggle; and now, my
heart, full freighted as it was with the fondest hopes
girl ever cherished, lies crushed and dying beneath
the waves of that gloom which will henceforth be my
portion in life.” She ceased, and for a moment stood
silent; then suddenly looking up, she said in a calmer
voice, “I am very silly to talk in this way to you. Do
not weep, dear Ellen; you see I can bear my sorrow
without weeping. Read my answer, and tell me
how you like it.” Mechanically I took the paper
she handed me. Through my tears I read the following
concise letter: —</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Grahame presents her compliments to Mr.
Noel, and is extremely happy that she has it in her
power to gratify him. Mr. Noel might have spared
himself any anxiety on the occasion, as, had he
known Miss Grahame better, he would have felt
sure that she would never have laid a serious claim
to a midshipman’s promise, made to a thoughtless
school-girl. He will, therefore, accept Miss Grahame’s
congratulations on the prospect of felicity
before him; and believe that no better wishes will
follow him and his bride to the altar than will be
offered by her.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='it'>“Lily Grove, June 2d.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And this was the letter. Not one word of the
breaking-heart; not a word of the anguish that had
so wrung her gentle spirit that day. Ah, Evelyn!
I did not mistake you, noble girl. I have since
entertained a different opinion of that letter. It was
sent, and for a day or two Evelyn was as cheerful,
apparently, as usual; but I saw the effort with which
she concealed her grief, and anxiously watched her.
Gradually, however, her calmness left her, and she
would sometimes give way to bursts of grief, fearful
to behold. This continued until she received letters
from home, urging her return, as Sarah and Arthur
were soon to be married. There was no scorn on
her lips as she read Sarah’s account of her approaching
nuptials; but the words were perused again
and again, and she seemed to drink in every syllable
as if it were her last draught of happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must now hasten to the close of my sad tale. A
friend of Mr. Grahame called on us a few days after
Evelyn had received the letters urging her return,
and informed her that he was about starting for Mobile,
and would be pleased to act as her escort home.
To my surprise, she excused herself by saying she
still hoped her father would come on, and she would
prefer waiting for him. When the gentleman left,
she said to me, “Ellen, I do not wish to go until all
is over, I can then meet them calmly, but now it
would be impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sarah was married without her, for Arthur had
his own reasons for urging the matter. It will be
remembered that no one but myself knew of Eva’s
unfortunate attachment, and therefore there was
no restraint in the letters she afterward received,
giving a description of the wedding, and the happiness
of the newly married pair. Alas! could one
of them have seen the change that had come over
Evelyn, happiness must have fled. A few weeks
of misery had made sad havoc among the roses of
her cheeks. She was now pale and drooping, her
step had lost its lightness, and she seldom smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the news of the marriage reached her,
she made preparations for her return, and an opportunity
offering shortly afterward, she left me, promising
to write as soon as she reached home. I
remember looking after her as she walked down
the lawn, and wondering if I should ever see her
again. Little did I then think how and where I
should see her. I never received the promised letter
from her, but one from her mother informed me of
what I am about to relate. Arthur Noel had expected
to leave for New Orleans a few days after
his marriage; but an unexpected summons to attend
as witness on a court-martial, then in progress in
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
Mobile, detained him; and he and his wife were
still at Mrs. Grahame’s when Eva arrived. She had
not been expected until the next day. The family
were all assembled in the drawing-room, when the
door was thrown open, and the old negro porter
exultingly announced, “Miss Evelyn.” All sprung
forward, except Arthur, and he stood spell-bound.
Evelyn advanced hastily into the room, but as soon
as her eye fell upon him, her early, her only loved—a
shriek, so wild, so shrill, burst from her lips, that
none present ever forgot it. With one bound she
was at his side, and looking into his face with an
expression of wo impossible to describe, she faltered
out his name, and sunk senseless on the floor, for
Arthur had no power to move. It was no time now
for Mrs. Grahame and Sarah to inquire into the
meaning of this. Arthur was aroused to lend his
aid in placing the prostrate girl on a sofa. A
physician was sent for, but she lay insensible for
many hours; and when she did awake, it was only
to make those who loved her so fondly, more
wretched. Reason, which for weeks had been
tottering on her throne, had fled forever—and Evelyn
Grahame, the lovely, the idolized daughter, was
a raving maniac!</p>

<hr class='tbk113'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the Spring of ——, two years after the
events related above, that, with a party of friends, I
visited the city of ——. The morning after my
arrival, the servant brought me up a card, and said
a gentleman was waiting in the drawing-room to
see me. I read the name—it was “<span class='sc'>Arthur Noel,
U. S. Navy</span>.” I started, and almost fainted. <span class='it'>That</span>
name! how vividly it recalled the past. Eva, my
never-forgotten friend, stood again before me in all
her pride of beauty, and then—I shuddered, and
dared not end my reflection. A hope, however,
soon rose in my breast that Arthur might bring me
cheering news; and with a lighter heart I descended
the stairs. I had never seen Mr. Noel, but Evelyn
had often described him to me; and I expected to
see a very handsome man. What was my astonishment,
therefore, when I entered the room, to behold
a tall, pale, haggard-looking man, with a countenance
so sad, that I almost trembled as I looked
at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss M——, I presume,” said he. I bowed, and
requested him to be seated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I arrived here this morning,” continued he,
“from Norfolk, and seeing your name upon the register,
have taken the liberty to call and ask a great
favor of you.” He paused, and seemed to be endeavoring
to suppress some violent emotion. He then
resumed, in a faltering tone, “You were Evelyn
Grahame’s dear friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes!” I exclaimed, “what of Evelyn—how
is she—where is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was stern, as he replied, “she is still
what my baseness made her. Where she is, I will
show you, if you will go with me. I must go—but
I cannot go alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I rang the bell, sent for my hat and shawl, and
we went out together. I could not help shuddering,
as I saw that my companion led the way to the
Lunatic Asylum. As we walked along, I ventured
to ask after his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is dead,” said he; “she died in giving birth
to a little girl, whom I have named Evelyn. Oh!
Miss M——, if Eva could only be restored! It is
the harrowing thought of my conduct toward her,
that has made me what I am—a gloomy, forlorn man.
I shun mankind, and feel unworthy to look my little
daughter in the face. But the physician who attends
dear Eva, has given me a hope that the sight of me
might cause a reaction, which would give a favorable
termination to her malady. Your presence at
the same time may assist this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God grant it!” I fervently ejaculated; and at that
moment we entered the court-yard of the Asylum.
The matron met us at the door, and Arthur, having
given her a note from Dr. ——, she immediately
led us to Eva’s apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is asleep now,” said the good woman, “but
you can go in, and wait until she awakes; she is
perfectly gentle, and will give you no trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We entered the small, but very neat room, and
approached the bed, whereon lay all that remained
of Evelyn Grahame. I felt as if my heart would
burst as I looked upon her. She lay upon her side,
one arm supporting her head. Her breathing was
soft and gentle as an infant’s. Her beautiful hair
had long been cut away, and the exquisitely shaped
head was fully exposed. Her beauty had all fled.
She looked forty years old; and the contraction of
the muscles about the mouth, peculiar to lunatics,
gave her face so stern an expression, that I could
scarcely believe she was the gentle Evelyn of
happier days. My tears flowed fast, while Arthur
stood and gazed intently upon her, his arms folded,
and a look of settled misery on his face. We had
stood at her side about ten minutes, when she
suddenly started up—“Mother!—Arthur!” she
cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am here, Eva, my own!” exclaimed Arthur,
throwing his arm around her. Her face instantly
flushed up, her eyes kindled; she leaned eagerly forward,
and gazed upon him; it was but for a second—her
head fell back, and she fainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Assistance was immediately called, and she soon
opened her eyes, looked around, then closed them
again. But that look was enough. We saw that
reason had again assumed its empire. The wildness
of the eyes was gone, and the mouth looked natural.
Involuntarily Arthur and myself fell upon our knees.
My heart was full of thankfulness, and I prayed;
but he, burying his face in his hands, sobbed aloud.
The noise roused Evelyn. She again opened her
eyes, passed her hand across her brows, and then
raising herself with an effort, said faintly, “Where
am I—where have I been. Arthur! and you, too,
Ellen! what does this mean; quick, some water!
Oh, God! I am dying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
Arthur sprung to his feet, and let her head droop
upon his arm. She took his hand in hers, then
motioning me nearer, grasped mine also; and for
some moments did not move. She then looked in
my face, and whispered, “I remember all, now;
but Arthur—dear Arthur! I do not blame you. I
hope you are happy—I soon will be. I feel that I
am dying. Surely, Sarah would not grudge me
the happiness I feel in breathing my last in your
arms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Evelyn!” cried Arthur, while his sobs almost
choked his utterance, “you must not, you shall not
die. You must live to forgive me, and let me make
some reparation for the wrong I have done you.
Speak to me, Eva! tell me that you will live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor girl made an effort to speak, but it was
in vain—one grasp of the hand—a short sigh—and
the pure spirit of Evelyn Grahame had fled to a
brighter sphere.</p>

<hr class='tbk114'/>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur Noel still lives, a poor, broken-hearted
victim of remorse.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. CAROLINE H. BUTLER.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>With</span> the engagement of Rupert Forbes and
Anna Talbot, started up a host of scruples and
objections among the friends of the parties—not only
manifested in the ominous shakings of very wise
heads upon several very respectable shoulders, in
prophetic winks and upturned eyes—but also found
vent in speeches most voluble and fault-finding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rupert Forbes was a young physician in moderate
circumstances, yet in good practice, established
in a pleasant country village, some two hundred
miles from the metropolis. Anna Talbot, the youngest
of the four unmarried daughters of a wealthy
citizen; a pet, a beauty, and a belle, who had been
educated by a weak, fashionable mother to consider
all labor as humiliating, and to whom the idea
of waiting upon one’s self had never broken through
the accustomed demands upon man-servants and
maid-servants, who from her cradle had stood ready
at her elbow, so that there seemed to be after all
some ground upon which the discontent of friends
might justifiably rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To think of Anna’s throwing herself away upon
a country physician, after all the expense we have
lavished upon her dress and education—it is absolutely
ungrateful!” said Mrs. Talbot, stooping to caress
a little lap-dog reposing on the soft cushion at
her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To give up the opera and the theatre for the
psalm-singing of a country church—horrible!” exclaimed
Belinda, humming the last new air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much for mama’s bringing Miss Anna out at
eighteen, just to show her pretty face, instead of
waiting, as was <span class='it'>our</span> right!” whispered Ada to Charlotte.
“Had she kept her back a little longer, we
might have stood some chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>We!</span>” cried Charlotte, contemptuously. “I
thank you, I am in no such haste to be married—do
you think <span class='it'>I</span> would stoop so low for a husband! For
my part I am glad Anna will be punished for all
her airs—she was always vain of her beauty—see
how long it will last! If she has been such a simpleton
as to snap up the first gudgeon her beauty
baited, why, let her take the consequences!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be forever inhaling the smell of pill-boxes—<span class='it'>pah</span>!”
said Ada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Instead of a heavenly serenade stealing upon
one’s blissful dreams—to be roused with, ‘Ma’am,
the doctor’s wanted—Mrs. Fidget’s baby is cutting
a tooth,’ or ‘Deacon Lumpkin has cracked his
skull!’” added Belinda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then such a host of low, vulgar relations—in
conscience I can never visit her!” quoth Charlotte.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, girls, I’m not sure after all but Anna
has done wisely,” said Mr. Talbot. “Forbes is a
fine young fellow, and will make her a good husband.
Poor thing! she will have many hardships,
I don’t doubt—on that account only, I wish her
affections had been given to some one better able
to support her in the style to which she has been
accustomed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I consider it, Mr. Talbot, a perfect sacrifice of
her life!” said his good lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were a few of the remarks on the lady’s
side, while on the part of the gentleman was heard:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How foolish to marry a city girl! A profitable
wife she’ll make, to be sure!” cried one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why couldn’t he have married one of his own
folks, I should like to know!” said a second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, one thing is pretty certain; Rupert Forbes
never will be beforehand—he has got to be poor
enough all his days, and it is a pity, for he is a clever
lad!” exclaimed a third.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I warrant she will hold her head high
enough above her neighbors,” chimed in a fourth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pride must have a fall—that’s one comfort”—added
another, “and I guess it wont be long first,
either!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
In addition to which charitable speeches, Rupert
received many long lectures, and many kind letters,
warning him against the fatal step he had so unwisely
determined upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opposition is often suicidal of itself, by bringing
about the very event it most deprecates. In the
present case, certainly, it did not retard the anticipated
nuptials, for upon a certain bright morning in
May, Rupert bore off his lovely young bride from
her gay, fashionable home to his own quiet little
nook in the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Anna exchanged her magnificent satin and
blonde for a beautiful traveling dress, had any one
demanded what were her ideas of the new life she
was now entering upon, she would have discoursed
most eloquently upon a cottage <span class='it'>ornée</span>, buried amid
honeysuckles and roses, where, on the banks of a
beautiful stream, beneath the shadow of some wide-spreading
tree, she could recline and listen to the
warbling of the birds, or, more delightful still, to the
music of Rupert’s voice, as he chanted in her ear
some romantic legend of true love—from this charming
repose to be aroused only by a summons from
some blooming Hebe, presiding over the less fanciful
arrangements of the cottage, to banquet, like the
birds, upon berries and flowers!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had the same inquiry been made of Rupert, as
he looked with pride and love upon the young creature
at his side, he would have traced a scene of
calm domestic enjoyment, over which his lovely
Anna was enthroned both arbitress and queen. To
grace his home all her accomplishments were to be
united with her native purity and goodness—her
good sense was to guide, her approbation inspire
his future career, and her sympathy alleviate all the
“ills which flesh is heir to!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was certainly expecting a great deal of a
fashionable young beauty, whose life might be
summed up in the simple word—pleasure; and
whose ideas of country life were gathered from
very romantic novels, or perhaps a season at
Saratoga! But then Rupert was very much in
love—walking blindfolded, as it were, into the
snares of Cupid!</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing certainly the fair young bride brought
to the cottage, along with her accomplishments—viz.,
a large trunk, filled with the most beautiful and
tasteful dresses which fashion could invent—laces,
handkerchiefs of gossamer texture, gloves the most
delicate, fairy slippers, brooches, bracelets, rings,
shawls, mantles, not omitting a twenty dollar hat,
with bridal veil of corresponding value. Such was
the <span class='it'>trousseau</span> of the young physician’s wife!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anna herself had no idea that such costly and
fanciful articles were not perfectly proper for her
new sphere, and if her mother thought otherwise,
as most probably she did, her desire to impress the
“<span class='it'>country people</span>” with a sense of her daughter’s importance,
and of the great condescension it must
have been on her part to marry a country doctor,
overcame her better judgment.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, my dearest Anna, yonder is our pleasant
little village!” exclaimed Rupert, pointing as he
spoke to a cluster of pretty houses, nestling far
down in the green valley below, now for the first
time visible as the carriage gained the summit of a
hill, while here and there the eye caught bright
glimpses of a lovely stream winding along the luxuriant
landscape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an enchanting spot!” cried Anna, pressing
the hand of her husband to her lips—“how
romantic!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is indeed lovely, Anna—but remember ‘’tis
distance lends enchantment;’ a nearer view may
destroy some of its present beauty,” said Rupert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet it will be lovely still, dear Rupert, for our
home is there!” exclaimed Anna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No wonder the heart of the happy husband bounded
with delight at such words from such beautiful lips!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you can discern the church through those
venerable elms, which were planted by hands long
since mouldering in the dust,” said Rupert. “And
see, dear Anna, as we draw nearer, how one by
one the cottages look out from their leafy screens,
as if to welcome you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O it is all perfectly charming, Rupert! Now
which of these pretty dwellings is to be our abode?”
inquired Anna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just where the river bends around yonder beautiful
green promontory; do you see two large trees
whose interlacing branches form as it were an arbor
for the little cottage reposing in the centre? There,
my beloved Anna, there is your future home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O it is a perfect beauty spot—how happy, how
very happy we shall be!” exclaimed Anna with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May your bright anticipations, my dear one, be
realized,” said Rupert. “Sure I am that if the tenderness
and devotion of a fond heart can secure
you happiness, it will be yours—yet as on the sunniest
skies clouds will sometimes gather, even so
may it be with us, and our brilliant horizon be
darkened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, talk not so gravely, Rupert,” cried
Anna, “depend upon it, no clouds but the most
rosy shall flit o’er our horizon! But do order the
coachman to drive faster—I am impatient to assume
the command of yonder little paradise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriage soon drew up within the shadow of
those beautiful trees which Rupert had already
pointed out to his fair young bride, and in a few
moments Anna found herself within the walls of her
new home, and clasped to the heart of her happy
husband, as he fondly impressed upon her brow the
kiss of welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a bird, from room to room flitted the gay
young wife, so happy that tears of tenderness and
joy trembled on her beautiful eyelids. True, here
were no costly mirrors to throw back the form of
beauty—no rich couches of velvet inviting repose—the
foot pressed no luxurious carpet, nor did hangings
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
of silken damask enshroud the windows; yet
the cool India matting, the little sofa covered with
snowy dimity, the light pretty chairs, and thin muslin
curtains looped gracefully over windows looking
out upon a charming shrubbery, were all infinitely
more agreeable to Anna. No doubt, accustomed as
she had ever been to all the elegancies of life, the
very novelty of <span class='it'>simplicity</span> exerted a pleasing influence—still
affection must claim its due share in her
gratification. When at length every nook and corner
had felt her light footstep, and echoed with her cheerful
tones, they returned to the little sitting-room, and
while the soft evening wind stole through the honeysuckles,
and twilight deepened into darkness, the
happy pair traced many golden-hued visions, stretching
far into the dim future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professional duties summoned Rupert from home
early the following morning, and Anna was left to
her own disposition of time. While the dew-drops
yet quivered on the fresh, green grass, she had
tripped through the orchard, the meadow, and garden,
inhaling the pure morning air, and listening
with unspeakable delight to the music of the birds.
To her uninitiated view the scene was perfectly
Arcadian, where all her visions of rural felicity were
to be more than realized. Anna was, perhaps,
“born to love pigs and chickens,” for each in turn
received a share of attention worthy even the
heroine of Willis, and neither did the faithful dog, or
more wheedling grimalkin escape her notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhat tired at length with her rambles, she
returned to the house, and now, for the first time,
faint shadows of reality rested upon love’s romance.
She was surprised to find the rooms in the same
disorder she had left them—her trunks were yet
unpacked, and the chamber strewed with all the
litter of traveling. She wondered if the maid would
never come to arrange things—it was certainly
very shocking to have no place to sit down, properly
in order. She looked for a bell—she might as well
have looked for a fairy wand to summon the delinquent
housemaid. That she could do any thing
toward a more agreeable <span class='it'>at-home-ness</span> was a fact
which did not occur to her; so she threw herself
upon the sofa, resolving to wait patiently the appearance
of the servant. In the pages of a new
novel she had already lost her chagrin, when the
door was suddenly thrown wide open, and a tall,
strapping girl—how unlike the Hebe of her imagination!—putting
her head into the room, exclaimed, —</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, aint you coming to get up dinner, I should
like to know; the pot biles, and <span class='it'>he</span>’ll be here in a
minute, for it’s e’en a’most noon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you speaking to?” said Anna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be smart, <span class='it'>Miss</span> Forbes, to ask that!
Why, I guess, I’m speaking to you; I don’t see
nobody else. Maybe you don’t know it’s washing-day;
and I aint used to cooking and doing every
thing on such days, I can tell you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anna had good sense enough to know that the
girl did not mean to be impertinent, so she answered
mildly, “Very well, I will come.” And putting
down her book, she followed her into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kitty immediately resumed her station at the
wash-tub, leaving her young mistress to solve alone
the mysteries of that glowing fire-place, and heedless
of her presence, struck up a song, pitching her voice
to its highest key, and in the energy of her independence,
splashing and swashing the glittering
suds far above her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Anna looked around despairingly. What
was <span class='it'>she</span> to do—what <span class='it'>could</span> she do! There was the
pot boiling, fast enough, to be sure; so fast that the
brown heads of the potatoes came bobbing up spitefully
against the lid, as if determined to break
through every obstacle in the way of their rising
ambition. There, too, was a piece of meat, raw and
unseemly, stretched out upon a certain machine,
ycleped a gridiron, by old housekeepers, yet of whose
use or properties Anna was sadly at fault. To extricate
herself from her embarrassment she knew
she must first crave light, so feeling as if about to
address some pythoness of those mysterious realms,
she humbly demanded, —</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Kitty, what can I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do—I guess you’d better lift off that pot pretty
quick, <span class='it'>Miss</span> Forbes, or the ’taters will be all biled to
smash!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lift off that pot—that great, heavy iron pot! <span class='it'>She!
Anna!</span> whose delicate hands had never scarcely
felt a feather’s weight! Anna was confounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would do it for me,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I guess I aint going to crock my hands
when I’m starching the doctor’s shirts!” quoth Kitty,
with a toss of her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After many awkward attempts, poor Anna at
length succeeded in <span class='it'>tilting</span> the huge pot from off
the hook which held it suspended over the crackling
flames, though not without imminent danger of
scalding her pretty feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sakes alive, what a fuss!” muttered the girl,
“and a nice grease spot, too, for me to scour up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mildness and patience of Anna, however, at
length overcame the stubbornness of Kitty—so true
it is that the most obstinate natures will yield to
kindness and gentleness. Wiping her sinewy arms
upon her apron, which she then took off and threw
into a corner, she came forward, evidently rather
ashamed of herself, to the assistance of the perplexed
young housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess, <span class='it'>Miss</span> Forbes, if you’ll just set the table
in there, before <span class='it'>he</span> comes, I’ll do the steak, and peel
the ’taters; maybe you aint so much used to this
sort of work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anna, gladly yielding up her place, proceeded to
prepare the little dining table, which she managed
with more tact, yet keeping a watchful, inquiring
eye upon the movements of Kitty, that she might be
more <span class='it'>au fait</span> to business another time. Still the
high-bred beauty, as she continued her employment,
missed many things which she had always considered
indispensable—inquired for silver forks—napkins—and
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
even puzzled poor Kitty’s brain by
demanding where the finger-glasses were kept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silver forks!” cried Kitty, “I never heard of
such a thing. Do tell, now, if city folks be so proud!
Napkins! I guess you mean towels. Why <span class='it'>he</span> always
wipes on that are roller in the back <span class='it'>pizaz</span>. Finger-glasses!
Sakes alive!—what does the woman mean?
<span class='it'>Finger-glasses!</span> Well, that beats all creation, and
more too!” and with a hearty laugh, she slapped
the steak upon the platter just as the gig of Rupert
stopped at the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The happy wife, now forgetting all annoyances,
flew to meet her beloved husband, and while partaking
of their simple dinner, greatly amused him
by her artless details of that morning’s experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Rupert was obliged to go out again immediately,
leaving Anna once more solitary. She had,
however, learned a lesson; and knowing it would
be vain to look for Kitty’s assistance, she herself unpacked
her beautiful dresses, feeling sadly at a loss
for commodious bureaus and extensive wardrobes
to contain her splendid paraphernalia. To hang up
those rich silks and satins on wooden pegs against
a white-washed wall, seemed desecration; so these
she refolded, and placed once more in her trunk,
determining in her own mind that Rupert must at
once supply those essential articles, which she was
very sure it would be impossible to do without.
Countless bareges, cashmeres, and mousselines,
however, cast their variegated tints through the
chamber, and the one bureau, and the little dressing-table
were loaded with finery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After arranging every thing in the best manner
she could, Anna exchanged her white morning
negligée for a light silk, and drawing on a pair of
gloves, went below to await the return of Rupert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardly had she sat down, when she perceived
several ladies coming up the walk, while a loud
knocking at the street-door almost immediately,
as certainly announced them to be visiters. Supposing,
of course, Kitty would obey the summons,
she remained quietly turning over a book of engravings.
The knocking was several times repeated,
and Anna beginning to feel uneasy at the delay,
when —</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Miss</span> Forbes!” screamed Kitty, from the kitchen,
“why on arth don’t you let them folks in! I guess
I aint a going to leave my mopping, and my old
gown all torn to slits!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment indignation at the insolence of her
servant crimsoned Anna’s brow. This was, indeed,
an episode in the life of a city belle—to be ordered
by a menial to attend the door—to appear before
strangers in the capacity of a waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Happily, the unceremonious entrance of the ladies
relieved her perplexity. She received her visiters
with that ease and grace of manner so peculiarly
her own, at once placing the whole party upon the
footing of old acquaintances, and <span class='it'>almost</span> disarming
even the most prejudiced, by her affability and
sweetness. To have wholly done so would have
been a miracle indeed, so much were many of her
new neighbors for doubting that any good or usefulness
could pertain to one brought up amid the
frivolities of the city.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The little village of D—— was primitive in its
tastes and habits. Remote from any populous city
or town, it was neither infected by their follies, nor
rendered more refined by association. Railway
speed had not there conquered both time and space;
the journey to the city was yet a tedious one of
days, over high hills and rocky roads, consequently,
an event not of very frequent occurrence. Yet, however
these “dwellers of the valley” might lack for
refinement, or the high-bred polish of fashionable
society, there was a great deal of honest worth and
intelligence among them—true hospitality, and
genuine benevolence both of precept and practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>True, scandal here, as elsewhere, found wherewith
to feed her craving appetite; and busy-bodies,
more at home in their neighbor’s kitchens than
their own, walked the streets inspectingly; yet, as
the same may be said of almost every place, let not
our little village be therefore condemned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of a week almost every person in
the town had called to see Anna, from various
reasons, no doubt; some from real neighborly kindness,
others solely out of regard for the young doctor,
and not a few from curiosity; yet as they carried
not these motives in their hands, Anna, of course,
could not determine by their pressure, whose welcome
was the most hearty and sincere, and therefore
extended to all the same courteous reception.
Also, in the same short space of time, her work-basket
was filled with all sorts of odd recipes for
all sorts of odd things—candles, cake, bread, bruises,
beer, puddings, pickles, pies, and plasters, soap and
sausages, as gratuitous aids to the young, ignorant
housekeeper, by her well-meaning neighbors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opinion, by the by, which Anna’s new acquaintances
formed of her, may, perhaps, be best
gathered from a colloquy which took place one
afternoon at Mrs. Peerabout’s, over a social cup
of tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” exclaimed that lady, who from her bitterness
was generally considered as the <span class='it'>aloes</span> of the
neighborhood, “well, I, for one, have been to see
the bride, as you call her, and of all the affectedest
rigged up creatures I ever see, she beats all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She certainly has one of the sweetest faces I
ever saw,” said another. “Don’t you think, Mrs.
Peerabout, she is very pretty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed, I don’t! ‘handsome is that handsome
does,’ I say. Pretty! why I’d rather look at
our Jemima’s doll, that her Aunt Nancy sent her
from Boston. Gloves on!—my gracious! At home
in the afternoon, a sitting down with <span class='it'>gloves</span> on, looking
at pictures! A useful wife she’ll make Rupert
Forbes, to be sure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they say, too,” said Miss Krout, “she can’t
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
even cook a beefsteak, and almost cried because
she had not a silver fork to eat her dinner with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” added Mrs. Peerabout, “so she did, and
could not even put on a table-cloth without help,
Kitty says!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but, Aunt,” interposed a pretty girl, “Kitty
also said that she was so pleasant, and spoke so
pretty to her, that she really loved to help her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what beautiful eyes she has!” exclaimed
another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I have not said any thing against her eyes,
but just look at her rigging, Susan,” put in Mrs.
Peerabout, draining her fourth cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must remember, Mrs. Peerabout,” said
Mrs. Fay, the lawyer’s wife, “that Mrs. Forbes has
never lived in the country, and has probably always
been accustomed at home to dress just as much,
if not more. You must excuse me if I say I really
think you judge her too hard. For my own part,
I confess myself favorably impressed by what I
have seen of her. Recollect, she is entirely ignorant
of our ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she had better have stayed in the city,”
interrupted Miss Krout, spitefully; “for my part,
Mrs. Fay, I don’t like such mincing fol de lol ways
as she has got!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she will learn,” said Mrs. Fay mildly, “she
will conform to our customs I do not doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Learn!</span> I guess so—a sitting with gloves on
and curls below her girdle—I aint a fool, Mrs. Fay!”
said Aloes.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Although Anna was really much pleased with the
majority of her new acquaintances, their manners
and conversation, as also their style of dress, so
entirely different from what she had been accustomed
to, did not escape her criticism, yet, for the
sake of her husband, she was resolved to overcome
her prejudices, if so they might be called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Speaking of them one day to Rupert, she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt they are very excellent, worthy people,
but it does not appear to me <span class='it'>now</span> that I can ever
really learn to take any pleasure in their society—yet
I hope I shall always treat them with perfect
politeness, and kindness too, for they are very warm
friends of yours, Rupert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Anna—they are indeed good friends
of mine, and so will they be, too, of yours, when
they know you better; and you also, my dearest,
will find that beneath their plain exterior and homely
speech they have warm hearts, and minds far above
many of those who figure largely in what is termed
the <span class='it'>best society</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not doubt it, Rupert,” replied Anna. “Well,
I must try to conform myself to their habits, I see,
and for your sake I hope they will love me, for it is
very plain to me, from some words which one of
the good ladies accidentally let fall, that they consider
me now a most useless, unprofitable wife—a
mere image for a toy-shop, and that I shall prove a
perfect stumbling-block in the way of my dear husband’s
advancement. Now tell me,” she continued,
and tears filled her beautiful eyes, “what can I do
to gain their friendship, and convince them that I
prize my dear Rupert’s respect and affection too
highly not to exert myself to be worthy of them—tell
me, Rupert, what I can do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Act yourself, my darling wife,” said Rupert, kissing
her, “be as you ever are, kind and lovely. It
is true many of my best friends do not approve of
my choice, but do not trouble yourself about their
approbation—only act in your new sphere as your
own good sense and native kindness prompts you,
and you will be sure of it. I sometimes think it
was cruel in me to woo you away from your home
of splendor to this retired, uncongenial spot. I fear
you can never be really happy here, and in spite of
your love for me, will often sigh for the luxuries you
so cheerfully gave up for my sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O say not so, dear Rupert—I shall be most happy
here, indeed I shall—with your love and approbation
how can I be otherwise—they will stimulate me to
conquer many false notions, inherent from my cradle.
I will not deny,” continued Anna, “for I scorn evasion,
and will make a clean breast of my follies,
that I have already <span class='it'>fancied</span> the necessity of many
things to render me even comfortable—you smile,
Rupert, and there have been moments of <span class='it'>ennui</span>,
when I have felt almost contempt for things around
me—I have even given way to anger at what I at
first supposed insolence in Kitty. She is, to be sure,
a rough, unmannerly girl, but it is because she has
never been taught better; I know she has a kind
heart, and that with a little management I shall
soon be able to convince her of the impropriety of
many things she now does from ignorance—not
willfulness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be cautious, Anna—Kitty will take
umbrage at the slightest hint, and be off without a
moment’s warning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I think better of her,” said Anna. “We
shall see. I have been thinking,” she continued,
“how much many mothers are to be blamed for not
better preparing their daughters for the duties of
domestic life—that sphere where a woman’s usefulness
and influence are most felt. There is no denying
that almost before little Miss slips her leading-strings,
she is taught to regard marriage as the chief
aim of her life—she is taught to sing and dance—she
has drawing-masters and music-masters, French
and Italian—and for what reason? Why is she
kept six hours at the piano, and scarcely allowed to
speak her mother tongue?—why, that she may get
married! That object cared for—the <span class='it'>future</span> is left
a blank—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” interrupted Rupert, “very much like rigging
out a ship with silken sails and tinseled cordage,
and then sending her forth on a long voyage
without provisions!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly, Rupert. To my mind housekeeping
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
in all its branches should be considered as much of
an accomplishment in the education of young ladies,
as a perfect knowledge of music or any of the fine
arts! Had my parents spent one quarter the time
and expense upon my acquirements as a <span class='it'>wife</span>, which
they did to render me fashionable and agreeable in
the fastidious eyes of <span class='it'>their</span> world, how much better
satisfied I should feel—how much more confidence
that I have not imposed upon your affection by a
total unfitness for the duties of a wife—indeed, my
dear Rupert,” said Anna, smiling, “you ran a great
risk when you fell in love with me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will not trace the daily walk of our heroine
further, but leave it to the reader to fancy from what
has already been said, how thickly the thorns mingled
with the roses on her path of new married life!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at the close of one year mark the result—one
year of patient trial to our young wife! Many vexations,
both real and imaginary, had been hers, yet
she loved her husband, and resolved to overcome
all the errors of her education, that she might be to
him the helpmate—the friend—the beloved companion
she felt he deserved. Where there is a will,
it is said, there is always a way, and Anna bravely
conquered the difficulties which at first presented
themselves. Even those who most criticised her
first attempts at housekeeping might now have taken
lessons themselves from the neatness and order
which reigned throughout her establishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rebellious Kitty yielded gradually to the gentle
dominion of her charming mistress. Miss Krout
sweetened her vinegar visage, and even presented
Anna with a jar of pickles of her own preparation,
while Mrs. Peerabout acknowledged that the “Doctor’s
city wife was wonderful—<span class='it'>considerin’</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>May my simple story encourage the young wife
to meet those trials in her domestic path, from which
none are wholly exempt, with patience and meekness—let
her remember that “<span class='it'>Love considereth not
itself</span>,” and</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Homes and Haunts of the Most Eminent British Poets.
By William Howitt. The Illustrations Engraved by H.
W. Hewett. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Harpers have issued this charming book in a form
of appropriate elegance. The paper, printing, binding, and
illustrations are all that could be desired. Few volumes
have been published during the season more worthy of a
place upon the parlor table. The title of the book hardly
conveys an idea of its full contents. It is in fact biographical
and critical as well as descriptive, and portrays the
poets in their homes and haunts, giving copious extracts
from their writings, illustrative of their personal character,
and tracing the history of their minds as they were influenced
by events and circumstances. It must have cost
the author much time and labor. Facts and anecdotes
have been carefully culled from a wide variety of books,
and England, Scotland and Ireland have been personally
explored in search of the “homes and haunts.” The latter
are described from the author’s own observations. Much
interest is given to this portion of the work by a detail of
the curious little adventures which occurred to the author
in his wanderings, and the strange sort of prosers he found
domesticated among places and scenes consecrated by song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In criticising the writings and character of his band of
poets, Howitt is often acute and sympathizing, but occasionally
allows his own passions and prejudices to pervert
his view. The chapter on Southey is an instance. Howitt
is a liberal of the extreme school, and is consequently
much of a bigot in politics and religion. Many uncharitable
judgments, much heedless invective, and some mean
malice, deform his volumes. We should judge him, in
spite of his Quaker coat, to be proud and revengeful, and
very impudent. The latter quality is as manifest in his
praise as denunciation. Were we unfortunate enough to
be a living poet, and Mr. Howitt unfortunate enough to
include us in his collection, we should have a strange inclination
to “insert” a dagger into him, or contrive in
some way to break his neck. There is no delicacy in his
personal references. Those qualities which make the
book piquant to the reader, must be very offensive to the
objects of its blame or eulogy. Mr. Howitt tells a great
many things and hazards a great many conjectures, in regard
to the personal character of late and living poets,
which are at once exceedingly interesting and impertinent.
To read these portions of his volumes is like getting information
from a spy. We devour the narrative and
despise the narrator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book contains chapters on Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspeare,
Cowley, Milton, Butler, Dryden, Addison, Gay,
Pope, Swift, Thomson, Shenstone, Gray, Goldsmith,
Burns, Cowper, Keats, Shelley, Byron, Coleridge, Scott,
Mrs. Hemans, Campbell, Southey, Wordsworth, Wilson,
Moore, Rogers, Elliott, Landor, Tennyson, and some
dozen others. It will be seen that the work is large in its
subject, and that the materials are ample. It would not
be fair to test the book by its value as literary history or
criticism, though these are largely mixed up with the descriptive
portions; but considered as a brilliant series of
sketches, half way between familiar chat and refined delineation,
it has very great merits, and is full of interest.
Some of the anecdotes are excellent. At Stratford, Mr.
Howitt saw in a country school a little boy of ten years
old, who turned out to be a descendant of Shakspeare’s
sister Joan. The father of the lad was wretchedly poor,
and kept a low dram shop. Mr. Howitt gave the boy sixpence,
and told him he hoped he would make as great a
man as his ancestor. The money created a strong sensation
in the school, and young Will became a lion. When
Howitt was seen in the streets afterward, he was pointed
out by the boys as “that gentleman who gave Bill Shakspeare
sixpence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chapter on Crabbe is well done. There is one anecdote
given about Lord Thurlow, which had escaped our
memory. When he presented Crabbe a couple of livings
in the church, he accompanied it by the characteristic remark—“By
—, you are as like Parson Adams as twelve
to a dozen.” The account of Coleridge is replete with
anecdotes of his earlier life and his family. His father, an
Episcopal clergyman, was a miracle of absent mindedness.
His wife once directed him, when he went on a journey,
to put on a clean shirt every day. He followed her orders
literally, but forgot to remove the one underneath. He
came back six-shirt deep. In his sermons he gained vast
reputation among the poor and ignorant by quoting Hebrew
liberally, they thinking themselves especially favored
in hearing “the very words the Spirit spoke in.” For his
successor, who addressed them in simple English, they
entertained a kind of contempt. At school young Coleridge
was very miserable. The author of Cristobel was
there a martyr to the itch. His appearance as a boy is indicated
by the opinion expressed of him by his master
after a whipping. “The lad was so ordinary a looking
lad, with his black head, that I generally gave him at the
end of a flogging an extra cut; for,” said he, turning to
Coleridge, “you are such an ugly fellow.” Coleridge’s
first attempt at verse was in commemoration of his maladies
at the age of ten:</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Tad is schoolboy<span class='it'>ese</span> for ringworm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Coleridge left college he enlisted as a common
soldier in the dragoons, under the name of Silas Tomken
Comberbache. “Do you think,” said the examining officer,
“you could run a Frenchman through the body?”
“I don’t know,” replied Coleridge, “as I never tried;
but I’ll let a Frenchman run me through before I’ll run
away.” “That will do,” was the answer of the officer.
He was so bad a horseman that the drill-sergeant had continually
to warn the members of his squad—“Take care
of that Comberbache! take care of him, for he will rids
over you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the chapter on Wordsworth there is a very ingenious
attempt to prove the poet a Quaker, both in the doctrine
and spirit of his poetry. This is altogether the best thing
in the book, and to a high-churchman, like Wordsworth,
must be very gratifying. Howitt makes out a good case.
At the end he asserts that the writings of the old Quakers
“are one mass of Wordsworthianisms.” In some particulars,
it is asserted Wordsworth hath not reached the
moral elevation of his masters; as in regard to war, “he
is martial, and thinks Slaughter God’s daughter. They,
very sensibly, set Slaughter down as the daughter of a
very opposite personage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be easy to quote a hundred anecdotes from
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
these volumes, interesting either in themselves, or from
their relation to interesting persons. We must, however,
refer the reader to the book itself, and can guarantee him a
large fund of enjoyment from its perusal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best of these poems are but of average ability, and
together they make but an indifferent volume. They are
deficient in fancy, imagination, melody and originality—four
qualities of some importance to the reader, if not to
the writer. Mr. Calvert is a scholar, a traveler, has studied
the best writers of England, Germany and Italy, has had
every advantage of mental culture, and yet has committed
the impropriety of publishing a volume which would give
no reputation to the poet of a village newspaper. Better
things than he has included in his collection are born and
forgotten every day. The most readable pieces in the volume
are the translations from Goethe. We give a few
specimens:</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Orators of France. By Viscount de Cormenin. Translated
by a Member of the New York Bar. With an Essay
by J. T. Headley. Edited by G. H. Colton. New York:
Baker &amp; Scribner. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The popularity of this book in France has been very
great. The present translation is from the fourteenth Paris
edition, and shines with the author’s last polishing touches.
The introductory essay by Headley, on the rise of French
Revolutionary eloquence, and the orators of the Girondists,
contains much information which the reader of the sketches
will find useful. Mr. Colton has ably edited the work,
and supplied some fifty pages of biographical addenda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work itself is written in sharp, snapping style, each
sentence exploding like a percussion cap, and abundantly
charged with French enthusiasm and French affectation.
The translator has happily seized the spirit of the book,
especially its tone of military precision and authoritativeness.
The work is comprehensive in its subjects, sketching
the prominent orators of the Constituent Assembly, the
Convention, the Empire, the Restoration, and the Revolution
of July. The portraits of Mirabeau, Danton, Napoleon,
M. de Serre, General Foy, Constant, Royer Collard,
Manuel, Sauzet, La Fayette, Odillon-Barrot, Dupin, Berryer,
Lamartine, Guizot and Thiers, are exceedingly interesting,
as introducing us to men who are familiar to
everybody by name, but of whose personal appearance
and style of oratory few readers have had an opportunity
of knowing much, from the descriptions of an independent
eye and ear witness. The volume is very readable in spite
of its affected conciseness and elaborate rhodomontade, and
we have little doubt conveys many accurate impressions of
the French politicians and orators whose merits it discusses.
We know of few volumes better calculated to
give the reader a notion of the modern French mind.
Where the author, however, criticises politicians to whom
he is opposed in principle, he falls generally short of his
mark. He has little notion of the meaning of wisdom as
applied to action.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Life of Wesley; and Rise and Progress of Methodism.
By Robert Southey, L.L.D. Second American Edition,
with Notes, &amp;c. By the Rev. Daniel Curry, A. M. New
York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is an excellent edition of a most valuable and fascinating
biography. Its diction has all the charm of Southey’s
fluent and graceful style, and the subject is made intensely
interesting by the singular felicity of its treatment. No
person who has in his nature the slightest religious feeling
can read the book without instruction and delight. The
present edition is enriched with the notes and observations
which Coleridge penciled in his copy of the work. They
are exceedingly characteristic, and worth all the rest of the
notes put together. The American editor’s remarks are
often presumptuous and out of place. They serve no good
purpose, except in a few instances where they correct
some mistake in matters of fact. As a whole, however,
the edition is a very good one, and may be said to supplant
all others. It will doubtless have a vast circulation, not
merely among the Methodists, but among all classes, literary
and sectarian. We will guarantee that no reader
who once commences the book can leave it unfinished. It
is as interesting as one of Scott’s novels.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Horse and his Rider. By Rollo Springfield. New
York: Wiley &amp; Putnam. 1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a captivating little volume, half way between a
book for men and a book for boys. It is full of information
and interesting anecdotes, contains a number of elegant
illustrations, and is written in a style of much simplicity
and clearness. The author almost exhausts the subject for
the general reader. That portion devoted to the turf is
especially racy. The intelligence and humanity of the
noble animal have full justice done to them. The volume
might be called a voice from the animal kingdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this volume is one of those who write history,
not from books or hearsay, but from direct observation

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
